2. Script should be rewritten for the sage site as its different from the psycnet where you wanted to go into each one
3. PDK landing page for a volume https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/7-8 only shows the title but hard for AI to do anything without any given information.
4. Given current issue that could have many inside the "token" count for chatgpt is limited so I have limited each send request to 8000 characters which could cut off some lower titles on the page.
