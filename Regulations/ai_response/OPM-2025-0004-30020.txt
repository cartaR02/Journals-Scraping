**Center for American Progress Urges OPM to Reject Proposed Civil Service Reforms** 

The Center for American Progress (CAP) has submitted a letter to the Office of Personnel Management expressing strong opposition to a proposed rule aimed at altering performance and accountability standards for federal workers. The letter, sent on June 2, 2025, addresses concerns regarding the necessity and potential consequences of the proposed amendments.

In the letter, CAP officials argue that the proposed changes to the civil service rules are unwarranted. “The claim that it is too difficult to remove poorly performing policy-influencing federal civil servants appears to be a pretext for enabling disciplinary actions that need not be explained and cannot be challenged,” stated the CAP. The organization asserts that simply exempting certain positions from existing adverse action procedures fails to address the underlying issues with those procedures.

The letter further emphasizes that any necessary reform should be initiated by Congress, which crafted the current civil service system. “Fairness and efficiency demand that cumbersome adverse action procedures be reformed for the benefit of all federal agencies and the entire federal workforce,” officials pointed out. They cautioned that the proposed rule could ultimately diminish the effectiveness of the federal government and adversely impact national security.

The CAP letter also highlights concerns regarding the due process rights of affected employees, stating, “The analysis offered to justify the proposed rule fails to give adequate consideration to the due process rights and reliance interests of the affected employees.” Furthermore, they argue that the proposal’s assertion that an Executive Order can revoke finalized agency rules is flawed.

According to the letter, a competent, nonpartisan federal workforce is essential for serving Americans, regardless of their political beliefs. CAP contends that the merit system principles established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be upheld to maintain an effective government. “By unnecessarily expanding the ranks of employees who are excepted from the provisions of chapters 43 and 75, the proposal would result in a less — rather than more — effective federal workforce,” they concluded.

The letter was addressed to Charles Ezell, Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and sent by the Center for American Progress.

Office of Personnel Management

Re: Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service (RIN:
3206-AO80)
Dear Acting Director Ezell,
The Center for American Progress (CAP) submits herewith its comments on the Office of
Personnel Management’s (OPM’s) Proposed Rule entitled “Improving Performance,
Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (the “proposal” or the “proposed rule”).
The proposed amendments to 5 CFR chapter I, subchapter B are not necessary to improve
executive branch operations, nor will they address the alleged difficulties with chapters 43 and
75 adverse action procedures. The claim that it is too difficult to remove poorly performing
policy-influencing federal civil servants appears to be a pretext for enabling disciplinary actions
that need not be explained and cannot be challenged. If, as the proposal states, the problem lies
with the adverse action procedures themselves, then simply exempting a group of positions from
those procedures does nothing whatsoever to solve that problem. Fairness and efficiency demand
that cumbersome adverse action procedures be reformed for the benefit of all federal agencies
and the entire federal workforce. Congress crafted the current system and therefore is the
appropriate branch of government to assess the system, consider alternatives, and amend the
relevant statutes. Contrary to the assertions in the proposal, implementation of the proposed rule
not only will diminish the effectiveness of the federal government, but also will undermine
national security. Additionally, the proposal is unlikely to withstand judicial review, because the
analysis offered to justify the proposed rule fails to give adequate consideration to the due
process rights and reliance interests of the affected employees. Finally, the proposal incorrectly
asserts that an Executive Order can effectively revoke an agency rule that has been finalized
pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.
Americans depend on qualified, experienced federal workers to perform their duties regardless of
their personal political allegiances or policy preferences. The merit system principles codified in
the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) serve to ensure an efficient, competent,
nonpartisan federal workforce. By unnecessarily expanding the ranks of employees who are
excepted from the provisions of chapters 43 and 75, the proposal would result in a less -- rather
than more -- effective federal workforce. Accordingly, CAP encourages OPM not to finalize this
proposed rule.
Sincerely,
Center for American Progress
