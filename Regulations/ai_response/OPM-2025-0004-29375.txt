**Retired Federal Employee Opposes New Civil Service Proposal**

In a letter addressed to the Office of Personnel Management, Yvonne Haefner, a retired federal employee with experience in conservation, voiced her strong opposition to a proposed rule aimed at modifying performance and accountability standards within the civil service. The rule, titled “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” was published in the April 23, 2025 edition of the Federal Register.

Haefner outlined her concerns based on her personal experiences in the field. “I saw when those political heads lacked the knowledge that career employees have a lot of times in the field where I worked,” she stated. Through her observations, she identified a pattern of inefficiency when political appointees made decisions without the necessary expertise in conservation. She remarked, “If civil servants were hired not based primarily on expertise, but on who they knew, conservation practices would fail.”

She elaborated further on the challenges posed by the proposed rule, emphasizing the impact of job security on employee performance. “Employees who are hired at will and fired at will are not loyal. Performance suffers because there is the constant fear of being fired,” Haefner explained. She noted that her former colleagues are experiencing widespread anxiety over their job security, saying, “Right now fellow co-workers in the field fear for their jobs. Tomorrow they come to work and there is no one else there.”

Haefner concluded her letter with a clear stance against the proposed regulation, urging the agency to reconsider its approach to managing the workforce within federal agencies. She believes that understanding the complexities of the civil service is crucial for effective governance and conservation efforts.

The letter was sent to the Office of Personnel Management on June 1, 2025. Haefner is the sole signer of the correspondence.

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” Proposed Rule, 90
Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 Dear Office of Personnel Management:
Yvonne Haefner submits these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Proposed
Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed. Reg.
17182 (April 23, 2025).
I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.
1. I am a retired Federal Employee in a conservation field, who saw how political heads changed with
the party in control. I saw when those political heads lacked the knowledge that career employees have
a lot of times in the field where I worked.
2. Often the appointed political head made decisions that were detrimental with applying conservation
on the ground. Was this efficient? No! It often hindered the work being done. I saw private companies
applying conservation in a haphazard method without sound engineering or planning experience. “If civil
servants were hired not based primarily on expertise, but on who they knew, conservation practices
would fail
3. Employees who are hired at will and fired at will are not loyal. Performance suffers because there is
the constant fear of being fired. Right now fellow co-workers in the field fear for their jobs. Tomorrow
they come to work and there is no one else there.
For the reasons stated above, I oppose the proposed rule.
Sincerely,
Yvonne Haefner
Retired Federal Employee
