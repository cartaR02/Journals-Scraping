**Retired Federal Employee Voices Opposition to OPM Proposed Rule**

A letter addressed to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management raises concerns regarding a proposed rule aimed at enhancing performance and accountability in the civil service. Yvonne Haefner, a retired federal employee with a background in conservation, expressed her disapproval of the rule in her comments submitted on June 1, 2025.

Haefner took issue with the underlying principles of the proposed rule, stating, “I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.” With her experience spanning years in the federal workforce, she observed the consequences of political changes, noting, “I saw how political heads changed with the party in control.” This shift often resulted in decisions made by appointees lacking the necessary field knowledge that career employees possess.

In her letter, Haefner detailed specific concerns that arise from appointing political heads who may prioritizе connections over expertise. She remarked, "If civil servants were hired not based primarily on expertise, but on who they knew, conservation practices would fail." Her experience indicated that such practices could lead to inefficient application of conservation efforts, as she elaborated on the impact political decisions have on fieldwork.

Furthermore, Haefner highlighted the implications of an at-will employment system, which she argues undermines loyalty and performance. “Employees who are hired at will and fired at will are not loyal. Performance suffers because there is the constant fear of being fired," she asserted. This fear can create an unstable work environment, with colleagues expressing anxiety over job security.

Haefner's issues with the proposed rule stem from her experiences and observations within the federal workforce. The problems she outlines reflect broader concerns about the implications of prioritizing political affiliation over expertise in civil service roles.

The letter was sent to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management regarding the Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” It is solely authored by Yvonne Haefner, a retired federal employee.
