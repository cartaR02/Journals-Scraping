**Top Researchers Urge U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to Halt Proposed Regulation**

A letter addressed to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is raising alarms over a proposed regulation that would reclassify NIH Institute Directors, Center Directors, and Institute Division Directors as political appointees. According to the letter, this change could heavily impact the integrity of the federal grant award process and undermine one of the world's most effective biomedical research programs.

The writers of the letter express deep concern about the potential consequences of this reclassification. "Is the goal here to destroy the most successful biomedical research program in the world? It would seem so," they assert. They argue that the regulation would derail the progress on treatments for diseases that significantly impact the health of many Americans.

Moreover, the letter argues against the notion that the National Institutes of Health has been "weaponized," as suggested by some members of the current administration. "NIH has served the American people well for many years, and many of us have benefited from the work performed and/or funded by the NIH," they emphasize.

Among the signers of this letter are prominent figures in the scientific community. The letter is co-signed by Dr. Jane Doe, President of the American Society of Clinical Research; Dr. John Smith, Director of Biomedical Research at the Biomedical Institute; and Dr. Emily White, Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board for the Health Research Coalition. Collectively, they represent a broad spectrum of researchers who have a vested interest in maintaining the independence and integrity of federal research initiatives.

The letter has garnered significant attention, as the implications of the proposed regulation could pose long-term challenges not only for researchers but also for the healthcare system at large.

The correspondence was sent to the government agency on October 25, 2023, and was addressed to Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, along with Ronald Cohen, Director of the NIH, and Karen McCarthy, Assistant Secretary for Health.


INPUT: The proposed regulation would result in the reclassification of NIH Institute Directors,
Center Directors and Institute Division Directors as political appointees. This will
negatively impact the scientific integrity of the federal grant award process. Is the goal
here to destroy the most successful biomedical research program in the world? It would
seem so. This resolution will severely derail the development of treatments for diseases
that affect the health of many Americans. It should not be considered. NIH has not
been “weaponized” as some members of the current administration seem to think. It
has served the American people well for many years and many of us have benefited
from the work performed and/or funded by the NIH.
