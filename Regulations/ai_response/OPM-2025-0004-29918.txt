**Center for American Progress Voices Concerns Over Proposed Rule Changes in Federal Civil Service**

The Center for American Progress (CAP) has expressed serious concerns regarding the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Proposed Rule entitled “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” In a letter sent to Acting Director Charles Ezell, the organization strongly criticized the proposed amendments, arguing that they do not enhance executive branch operations and fail to address existing issues related to adverse action procedures.

"The claim that it is too difficult to remove poorly performing policy-influencing federal civil servants appears to be a pretext for enabling disciplinary actions that need not be explained and cannot be challenged," the letter stated. CAP contends that merely exempting certain positions from adverse action procedures does not rectify the alleged shortcomings within the current system.

The organization emphasized the need for a more equitable approach to accountability and performance within federal agencies. "Fairness and efficiency demand that cumbersome adverse action procedures be reformed for the benefit of all federal agencies and the entire federal workforce," CAP argued. The letter noted that Congress, as the governing body, is the appropriate institution to evaluate the system and enact necessary amendments.

In addition to concerns about fairness, CAP cautioned that the proposed rule could have broader implications. "Implementation of the proposed rule not only will diminish the effectiveness of the federal government, but also will undermine national security." They also pointed out potential legal challenges, asserting that the justification for the rule fails to adequately consider the due process rights of affected employees.

The merits of the current civil service system, particularly the principles established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, were also highlighted in the letter. CAP asserted that the workforce's competency and nonpartisan nature depend on these merit system principles and that the proposal threatens to weaken that structure.

CAP urged OPM not to finalize the proposed rule, reinforcing their stance that a more capable and impartial federal workforce is essential. 

The letter was submitted on June 2, 2025, to Acting Director Charles Ezell at the OPM.

Re: Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service (RIN:
3206-AO80)
Dear Acting Director Ezell,
The Center for American Progress (CAP) submits herewith its comments on the Office of
Personnel Management’s (OPM’s) Proposed Rule entitled “Improving Performance,
Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (the “proposal” or the “proposed rule”).
The proposed amendments to 5 CFR chapter I, subchapter B are not necessary to improve
executive branch operations, nor will they address the alleged difficulties with chapters 43 and
75 adverse action procedures. The claim that it is too difficult to remove poorly performing
policy-influencing federal civil servants appears to be a pretext for enabling disciplinary actions
that need not be explained and cannot be challenged. If, as the proposal states, the problem lies
with the adverse action procedures themselves, then simply exempting a group of positions from
those procedures does nothing whatsoever to solve that problem. Fairness and efficiency demand
that cumbersome adverse action procedures be reformed for the benefit of all federal agencies
and the entire federal workforce. Congress crafted the current system and therefore is the
appropriate branch of government to assess the system, consider alternatives, and amend the
relevant statutes. Contrary to the assertions in the proposal, implementation of the proposed rule
not only will diminish the effectiveness of the federal government, but also will undermine
national security. Additionally, the proposal is unlikely to withstand judicial review, because the
analysis offered to justify the proposed rule fails to give adequate consideration to the due
process rights and reliance interests of the affected employees. Finally, the proposal incorrectly
asserts that an Executive Order can effectively revoke an agency rule that has been finalized
pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.
Americans depend on qualified, experienced federal workers to perform their duties regardless of
their personal political allegiances or policy preferences. The merit system principles codified in
the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) serve to ensure an efficient, competent,
nonpartisan federal workforce. By unnecessarily expanding the ranks of employees who are
excepted from the provisions of chapters 43 and 75, the proposal would result in a less -- rather
than more -- effective federal workforce. Accordingly, CAP encourages OPM not to finalize this
proposed rule.
Sincerely,
Center for American Progress
