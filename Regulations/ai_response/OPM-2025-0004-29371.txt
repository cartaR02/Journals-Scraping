**Strong Opposition to Proposed Reclassification of Civil Service Employees**

In a recent letter to the Office of Personnel Management, retired Colonel Ronald E. Myers expressed strong opposition to a proposed regulation titled "Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." He argues that the measure threatens the integrity of the federal workforce by potentially reintroducing Schedule F, a directive that could lead to the politicization of civil service roles.

"Myers states, 'Despite its title, this proposed rule would do the opposite: it effectively eliminates long-standing safeguards against the politicization of the federal workforce,'" emphasizing the risks associated with such changes. He described Schedule F as "the greatest threat to the merit-based system since its inception," noting that it would convert critical civil service positions into political appointments, reversing over a century of progress established by the Pendleton Civil Service Act.

The implications of Schedule F, according to Myers, are deeply concerning. He warns that it would produce "an unprecedented level of political interference in the daily operations" of federal agencies, which could weaken performance and accountability, undermining democratic values such as transparency and the rule of law. According to Myers, the proposal is not merely a reform but "an open-ended invitation to purge qualified, nonpartisan civil servants based on perceived political disloyalty."

Myers presents alarming comparisons to other democracies, stressing that the United States already has a high number of political appointees compared to peer nations, limiting the effectiveness of governance. He urges for a reduction, citing concerns raised by the Volcker Commission in 1990 regarding the burgeoning number of politicos among top agency leaders.

“The civil service system is not perfect, but its purpose is vital: to serve the American people through lawful, competent, and nonpartisan administration of federal programs,” Myers emphasizes, calling into question the ramifications of Schedule F on professional integrity within public service.

The letter concludes with a call to action directed at the agency, stating, “For these reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw the proposed rule and to reaffirm its commitment to a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service.” 

The letter was sent to the Office of Personnel Management on [insert date] and is addressed to the agency's administrators, whose names were not provided in the content presented.


INPUT: Strong Opposition to Proposed Reclassification of Civil Service Employees
OPM Rule (RIN 3206-AO80, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004)
I write in strong opposition to the proposed Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
rule titled Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service (RIN
3206-AO80). Despite its title, this proposed rule would do the opposite: it effectively eliminates
long-standing safeguards against the politicization of the federal workforce and paves the way
for the reintroduction of Schedule F—a measure that threatens the foundational principles of
the American civil service.
Schedule F represents the greatest threat to the merit-based system since its inception.
It would enable sweeping conversion of policy-influencing civil service roles into political
appointments, thereby reversing over a century of progress that began with the Pendleton Civil
Service Act of 1883. This act was passed specifically to end the patronage-driven “spoils
system,” which rewarded political loyalty over competence and fueled corruption and
inefficiency in government.
The implications of Schedule F are deeply troubling. It would lead to an unprecedented
level of political interference in the daily operations of federal agencies, weakening
performance, reducing accountability, and undermining democratic norms such as
transparency, impartiality, and the rule of law. Far from being a targeted reform, Schedule F is a
blunt instrument—an open-ended invitation to purge qualified, nonpartisan civil servants based
on perceived political disloyalty.
The United States already stands out among developed nations for the sheer number of
political appointees—around 4,000. In contrast, peer democracies typically restrict political
appointments to the highest leadership positions. In the U.S., entire tiers of agency leadership
are often filled with appointees, many of whom lack the institutional knowledge or experience
necessary for effective governance. Expanding this pool would only exacerbate delays in filling
roles and create further instability in agency leadership.
The 1990 Volcker Commission, led by former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker, called
for a reduction in the number of political appointees. It cited serious concerns about
performance, accountability, and continuity—issues that have only worsened with the increase
in appointees over the past three decades.
Schedule F is not an isolated initiative—it is the spearhead of a broader movement to
erode civil service protections and convert a professional workforce into one beholden to
partisan interests. Former President Donald Trump, who originated the Schedule F executive
order, has made his intentions unmistakably clear. He has described the federal workforce as a
“deep state” to be “destroyed,” and has vowed to impose sweeping loyalty tests across the
executive branch. In his own words: “We will pass critical reforms making every executive
branch employee fireable by the president of the United States.”
In the early days of his administration, numerous public servants have reportedly been
targeted or removed for failing to display personal loyalty—many without due process or
legitimate cause. The undefined scope and arbitrary application of Schedule F make it ripe for
abuse and retribution. Such a system would not only damage morale but also deter ethical
dissent and lawful whistleblowing—two cornerstones of accountability in democratic
governance.
Research by scholars such as Brian Feinstein and Abby K. Wood shows that political
appointees are more likely to represent ideological extremes, while career officials tend to hold
more moderate views. This suggests that expanding political appointments would not only
increase polarization but also decrease the consistency and stability of federal policymaking
across administrations.
While proponents of Schedule F claim it is a tool for restoring accountability, the reality
is far more dangerous. It is designed to strip civil servants of the protections that allow them to
serve the Constitution and the public—not the whims of political leaders. Trump himself has
framed Schedule F as a solution to his past grievances with civil servants who upheld the law
and resisted improper directives, such as those involved in the Ukraine aid scandal that led to
his first impeachment. Rather than being respected for defending the Constitution, these
individuals were harassed, sidelined, or forced out. Schedule F would make such reprisals
routine.
Moreover, the original Schedule F executive order was developed behind closed doors
without consultation from civil service scholars, public management experts, or frontline
practitioners. It was crafted for one administration’s political aims, not as a product of serious
or transparent policy analysis. The proposed OPM rule reanimates this deeply flawed
framework, threatening to undo a system carefully built over generations to ensure
professionalism, integrity, and continuity in government.
The civil service system is not perfect, but its purpose is vital: to serve the American
people through lawful, competent, and nonpartisan administration of federal programs. The
Founders designed a government of checks and balances, and an independent, professional
civil service is one of those checks. Schedule F and this proposed rule dismantle that protection
and centralize power in a way that should alarm every American—regardless of party.
For these reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw the proposed rule and to reaffirm its
commitment to a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. If reform is needed, it should be led by
Congress in a transparent and bipartisan manner—not imposed by executive fiat in pursuit of
political loyalty.
Respectfully submitted,
