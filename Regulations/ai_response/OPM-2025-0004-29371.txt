**Public Opposition to OPM Rule Threatening Civil Service Integrity**

A strong wave of opposition is emerging against a proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management aimed at altering the structure of civil service employment. Retired Colonel Ronald E. Myers has penned a letter expressing grave concerns over the rule titled “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (RIN 3206-AO80). 

"I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule," Myers states. He argues that, despite its ostensibly positive title, it risks dismantling essential safeguards that protect against the politicization of the federal workforce. Myers warns that the rule could lead to the reintroduction of Schedule F, a controversial measure that would blur the line between civil service roles and political appointments. 

“With Schedule F, we would see a sweeping conversion of policy-influencing positions into political offices,” he adds, emphasizing the historical importance of the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, which was enacted to eliminate the patronage system that prioritized political loyalty over competence. 

Myers contends that the implications of Schedule F are alarming. “It would lead to an unprecedented level of political interference in the daily operations of federal agencies,” he warns, emphasizing how this shift could weaken performance and accountability. He highlights the dangers of expanding political appointments further, especially given that the U.S. already has around 4,000 political appointees, a number disproportionately high compared to peer democracies.

The letter underscores research indicating that political appointees often harbor more extreme ideological views, whereas career officials tend to be more moderate. “This suggests that expanding political appointments would not only increase polarization but also decrease the consistency and stability of federal policymaking,” Myers says.

In concluding his correspondence, Myers urges the OPM to withdraw the proposed rule and recommit to a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. “If reform is needed, it should be led by Congress in a transparent and bipartisan manner,” he asserts, directly challenging the current approach.

The correspondence was sent to the Office of Personnel Management and its Director, Kiran Ahuja, on October 10, 2023.
