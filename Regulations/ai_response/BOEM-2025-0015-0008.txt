**Local Business Owner Fights Against Offshore Drilling in Letter to Federal Agency**

A Coconut Creek business owner has voiced strong opposition to offshore oil and gas leasing in a recent correspondence with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Susan Steinhauser, owner of Aquatics for Life, expressed her concerns about the potential risks associated with offshore drilling, particularly off the east coast of Florida.

In her letter, Steinhauser argued that “coastal economies like Florida’s are built on the foundation of clean beaches, healthy ecosystems, and vibrant tourism.” She emphasized that the impact of offshore drilling could severely jeopardize these essential elements. Steinhauser pointed out that even the mere perception of risk from oil and gas activities can lead to adverse effects on tourism, property values, and investor confidence within the community.

The small business owner underscored the severe consequences of a potential oil spill, highlighting that it could have long-lasting ramifications for local businesses, fisheries, and the numerous jobs reliant on a healthy coastal environment. “The long-term threats to coastal livelihoods, local industries, and our natural resources far outweigh the potential short-term benefits to energy companies,” she stated.

Steinhauser urged the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to seriously consider these economic implications and prioritize the protection of coastlines in the next leasing program. She also called on elected officials in Congress to back policies that would safeguard shorelines and reject any attempts to expand offshore oil and gas development.

In closing her letter, Steinhauser expressed gratitude for the opportunity to submit her comments and highlighted the importance of considering the interests of coastal businesses and communities. 

This letter was sent to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management on May 12, 2025, addressed to Ms. Hammerle or other relevant officials within the agency. It marks a significant stand against proposed offshore drilling initiatives, reflecting the views of many local stakeholders concerned about environmental impact and economic stability.

RE: BOEM’s request for information regarding Offshore Drilling and the National Outer
Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program
Dear Ms. Hammerle or to Whom it May Concern,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to any new offshore oil and gas leasing off the
th
coast of the United States in the 11 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing
Program, particularly off the east coast of Florida, where I have had my business since 2014.
Coastal economies like Florida’s are built on the foundation of clean beaches, healthy
ecosystems, and vibrant tourism and marine industries like mine.
Offshore drilling puts all of that at risk. Even the perception of risk from oil and gas activity can
negatively affect tourism, property values, and investor confidence. A major spill would have
long-lasting consequences for small businesses, fisheries, and the thousands of jobs that rely on a
healthy coastal environment.
I believe it is NOT in the best interest of our community, or our economy, to open our coasts to
offshore drilling. The long-term threats to coastal livelihoods, local industries, and our natural
resources far outweigh the potential short-term benefits to energy companies.
I urge the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to take these economic concerns seriously and
to prioritize the protection of our coasts in the upcoming leasing program. I also call on our
elected officials in Congress to support policies that safeguard our shorelines and reject any
efforts to expand offshore oil and gas development.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments. I appreciate your consideration of the
interests of coastal businesses and communities like mine.
Sincerely,
Susan Steinhauser
Owner, Aquatics for Life
