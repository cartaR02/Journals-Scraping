**Outcry Against Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling in the Atlantic Continues**

A letter addressed to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management expresses strong opposition to including the Atlantic region in upcoming plans for offshore oil and gas exploration. Barbara MacKinnon, a resident of South Carolina, highlights the collective concerns of local officials, stakeholders, and residents, opposing the nation’s 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

"In 2018 and now in 2025, exploring and drilling in the Atlantic is still a terrible idea," MacKinnon stated, referencing strong opposition from the state's governor, Henry McMaster. "All the municipalities and counties along coastal South Carolina have opposed seismic surveying and drilling. Our coastal communities drive a $20 billion tourist industry that benefits the entire state."

MacKinnon references McMaster’s sentiments regarding the potential risks posed to the state's thriving tourism economy. She noted his statement, “We don’t want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.” Studies cited in the letter indicate that tourism is projected to significantly outperform economic gains from drilling, even under excessively optimistic projections by the oil industry.

She emphasizes the united front against seismic surveying and offshore drilling, stating, "More than 140 municipalities and county governments along the East Coast, along with 1,200 elected officials, oppose these actions due to the threats to marine life, commercial fisheries, and our coastal economies." The Gullah Geechee nation, noted for its unique heritage and coastal livelihood, also opposes such initiatives due to the potential negative impacts on its way of life.

Highlighting the dangers of seismic surveying, she warns about endangered species, specifically the North American right whale, asserting, “Man-made noise increases stress hormones, impacting their ability to reproduce.” Additionally, MacKinnon argued that the U.S. does not require new oil resources, as it is a net energy exporter capable of reinvesting in renewable energy alternatives.

Jessica Anderson, a spokesperson from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, was among the recipients of the letter. MacKinnon’s correspondence, sent on May 26, 2025, urges the agency to consider these critical points, which resonate with a growing consensus to protect the Atlantic coastline from oil and gas exploration. The letter was co-signed by Governor Henry McMaster, as well as other local officials and organizations concerned about the future of coastal ecosystems and economies.

For the many reasons outlined below, including the Atlantic in any plan for offshore exploration
and drilling was not a good idea in 2018 and is still a terrible idea. At that time the states, the
stakeholders, the local voices, the elected officials, the concerned citizens and especially the
governors strongly stated their opposition to plans to explore and drill. As a resident of South
Carolina, I direct you to the letter of the Governor of the state of South Carolina, Governor
Henry McMaster, who is strongly opposed. His letter is attached.1
As Governor McMaster notes, all the municipalities and counties along coastal South Carolina,
have opposed seismic surveying and drilling. I will not reiterate his points; but I will refer to his
statement in a speech noting that our coastal communities drive a $20 billion tourist industry,
which creates a tremendous benefit for the entire state, “We don’t want to kill the goose that
lays the golden egg.”
Economic studies done then showed that over the next twenty years, the tourism economy was
projected to grow to about 27 times the projected economic growth attributed to drilling for oil
and gas – even using the overly optimistic projections put forth by - and now discredited by -
the oil industry.2 For the entire report, see

The impact of tourism has not decreased; tourism has made a comeback after the COVID
hiatus.
East Coast opposition to offshore testing and drilling is bi-partisan and strong. More than 140
municipalities and county governments along the East Coast and 1,200 elected officials, an
alliance representing 41,000 businesses, and 500,000 fishing families oppose seismic airgun
surveying and offshore drilling because they threaten marine life, commercial fisheries, and
coastal economies.
Where the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico has a robust industrial infrastructure associated with
the oil and gas industries and few beaches, the coast of South Carolina is all beaches and
harbors and protected conservation areas. Not only do we not have industrial infrastructure, we
have no place to build it.
Among the communities opposed to seismic surveying and offshore drilling is the Gullah
Geechee nation, a unique amalgam of African ethnic groups and indigenous Americans with
their own languages and traditions whose livelihood and lifestyle is dependent on a vibrant
healthy coast and ocean wildlife – all of which will be threatened by seismic surveying and
drilling. https://usa.oceana.org/sites/default/files/662/gullah-geechee_nation.pdf
Nationwide, a poll released by Oceana in July 2024 revealed that two-thirds of American
voters (64%) support their elected officials protecting U.S. coastlines from new
offshore drilling, with 66% of voters in coast states supporting protection of our coastlines.
An additional hazard of the proposed seismic surveying and offshore drilling is the potential
demise of the endangered species the North American right whale. According to Whales.org,
man-made noise increases stress hormones in right whales, impacting their ability to reproduce.
Already the population is below 500 individuals and no new calves have been spotted in normal
calving areas. Seismic surveying, especially at the proposed level of five permits continuously
producing intense noise, puts the species, as well as dolphins, at great risk.

There is no reason to let this happen. We do not need the oil. The United States is already a net
energy exporter. We are now producing more energy than we consume; and we are exporting
more than we import:
But more importantly, renewable resources are the future. Although the current administration is
down-playing renewables, their efforts will only slow our progress. We are only letting the rest of
the world get ahead of us in employing their advantages.
If we must have more oil and gas, onshore wells are considerably safer. Accidental spills are
easier to contain on land. The Permian Basin still has a huge supply of untapped oil and the
nation as a whole, as of 2023, had 6,653 approved and available permits to drill. There is no
defensible reason for exploring for more leases in a vulnerable area like the Atlantic Coastal
region.
Let me remind you that President Trump supported halting offshore drilling planning in the
south- and mid- Atlantic in 2020. What he thought was right for the Atlantic in 2020 is still right in
2025.
How are you going to guarantee no horrific disasters such as Deepwater Horizon? You can’t in
such a dangerous industry.
And once a well is drilled, it never goes away; it presents a risk forever. Santa Barbara,
California’s, beach closures in 2015 were due to a well dug 30 years earlier. BOEM itself
reports there were 2,440 oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico between 1964 and 2015 resulting in a
total of over 12 million gallons of oil dumped into the Gulf – excluding the disastrous Deepwater
Horizon spill of over 200 million gallons. In 2016 alone, 497 accidents (damages, injuries and
spills) involving offshore oil rigs were reported. The number of human errors recorded is almost
as high in the 2000s as in the 1970s and 1980s. And some of the worst disasters have been
caused by human error; it cannot be regulated away.
In addition to human error, the Atlantic coastline is subject to terrible hurricanes. For reference,
in 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita damaged or destroyed 114 rigs in the Gulf. Any rig
constructed in the Atlantic would be subject to the same risk. If the Atlantic Ocean is opened to
oil & gas, it is not “if” but “when” there will be a spill or other catastrophe.
This is a forever decision. The Atlantic Coastal region must never be part of future oil and gas
exploration and leasing.

offshore ecosystem. The habitat disruption and other impacts that marine life could suffer due to
seismic testing are simply not worth whatever benefit our state might see from placing oil rigs
offshore.
I am also concerned about the risks associated with the construction of industrialized infrastructure
required to support offshore drilling operations. Massive refineries, gas storage tanks, and other
large-scale maintenance and operating facilities are not economically compatible either with existing
coastal residential and resort development or with our protected sea islands, estuaries, and tidal
marsh refuges.
As governor, it is my duty to future generations to protect our most precious assets and to make
decisions consistent with South Carolina’s strong conservation ethos. We have 47 state parks, two
national forests, and the Congaree National Park—the largest intact expanse of old growth
bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the southeastern United States. Moreover, South Carolina’s
Lowcountry region is home to four National Wildlife Refuges—Cape Romain, Ernest F. Hollings
ACE Basin, Santee, and Waccamaw—which collectively encompass over 115,000 acres of coastal
barrier islands, salt marsh ecosystems, blackwater rivers, and forested wetlands. We also have the
South Carolina Conservation Bank, which exists to protect and sustain our natural capital from
development incompatible with our incomparable beauty. And we are making a substantial push for
more solar energy—a clean and comparatively harmless alternative energy source.
Perhaps most alarming is the fact that South Carolina sits in the middle of “Hurricane Alley,” and we
are regularly in the path of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other severe aquatic weather events. In
September of 2017, Hurricane Irma had a tremendous impact on our coastline, flooding city streets in
Beaufort and Charleston. A year prior, Hurricane Matthew did the same. We all remember Hurricane
Hugo, which affected 1.8 million people, caused $6.5 billion in damages, and resulted in the loss of
35 lives. In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed 115 oil platforms and damaged 52 others in
the Gulf of Mexico. As a state which regularly faces such threats, we cannot countenance the
addition of even more risk by placing offshore drilling platforms in the path of these storms.
I ask that you—along with my good friend President Donald J. Trump—take these considerations
into account as you implement future offshore drilling plans.
Yours very truly,
Henry McMaster
