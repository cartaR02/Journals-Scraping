**Concerns Raised Over Offshore Drilling Plans in California**  

A letter sent to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management expresses concerns about the expansion of offshore drilling in California as part of the 1th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. The letter, penned by Jessilyn Reyes, a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, highlights the ecological risks associated with increased oil and gas activity along the state's coast. 

In her correspondence, Reyes states, “This area is home to a diverse range of marine species and ecosystems. Adding more oil and gas activity to their habitats does not seem ethical when there is such a high risk of oil spillage and other environmental damages.” Her appeal emphasizes the potential harm that offshore drilling could inflict on marine biodiversity and water quality.

Furthermore, Reyes raises concerns regarding the broader implications of fossil fuel investment amid the ongoing climate crisis. “With the rise of more efficient clean energy,” she continues, “it feels backwards and outdated to be investing in fossil fuels when there are more sustainable alternatives.” Reyes advocates for a shift towards cleaner energy resources, underscoring the importance of aligning policy decisions with environmental sustainability.

The student calls on the government agency to “take California’s aspirations of moving away from oil and protecting our coast seriously” and requests that the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf be excluded from the leasing program. “We should really be thinking about the future of our planet,” Reyes concludes, urging decision-makers to prioritize clean energy over drilling initiatives.

Reyes' letter reflects growing concern among environmental advocates and students regarding the implications of fossil fuel expansion, particularly given California’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewable energy sources.

The letter was sent to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management on [insert date], with no additional recipients disclosed.

 Hi, my name is Jessilyn Reyes and I am a student at the University of California, Santa
Barbara. I am writing to you to share my thoughts on the 1th National Outer Continental
Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. I have some concerns regarding the expansion
of offshore drilling, especially along our California coast. Through my environmental studies
class, I learned that this area is home to a diverse range of marine species and ecosystems.
Adding more oil and gas activity to their habitats does not seem ethical when there is such a
high risk of oil spillage and other environmental damages. Also, with the rise of more efficient
clean energy and the current climate crisis, it feels backwards and outdated to be investing
in fossil fuels when there are more sustainable alternatives. I hope BOEM takes California’s
aspirations of moving away from oil and protecting our coast seriously, and we keep the
Pacific OCS out of this leasing plan. We should really be thinking about the future of our
planet, and that entails clean energy, not drilling.
