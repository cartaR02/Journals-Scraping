**Student Voices Concerns Over National Offshore Leasing Plan**

A letter addressed to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has sparked discussion regarding the proposed National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. Jessilyn Reyes, a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, expresses her worries about the potential expansion of offshore drilling along the California coast in the correspondence. 

Reyes articulates, “This area is home to a diverse range of marine species and ecosystems. Adding more oil and gas activity to their habitats does not seem ethical when there is such a high risk of oil spillage and other environmental damages.” The student, who is enrolled in an environmental studies class, emphasizes the ecological importance of protecting marine life from the dangers of fossil fuel extraction.

In her message, Reyes underscores the disconnect between current energy investments and the pressing climate crisis. “With the rise of more efficient clean energy,” she notes, “it feels backwards and outdated to be investing in fossil fuels when there are more sustainable alternatives.” Her argument places emphasis on the urgency of adopting greener energy strategies rather than extending reliance on oil and gas.

The letter calls for the agency to consider California’s aspirations of steering away from oil exploration and to prioritize the preservation of the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf. Reyes passionately concludes, “We should really be thinking about the future of our planet, and that entails clean energy, not drilling.” Her plea highlights the growing movement among young activists advocating for environmental protection and sustainable energy solutions.

Reyes is the sole signer of the letter, which was sent to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management on October 20, 2023. As discussions about the leasing program progress, her concerns resonate with many within the environmental community who are urging a shift toward renewable energy initiatives and away from fossil fuel dependency.


INPUT: Hi, my name is Jessilyn Reyes and I am a student at the University of California, Santa
Barbara. I am writing to you to share my thoughts on the 1th National Outer Continental
Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. I have some concerns regarding the expansion
of offshore drilling, especially along our California coast. Through my environmental studies
class, I learned that this area is home to a diverse range of marine species and ecosystems.
Adding more oil and gas activity to their habitats does not seem ethical when there is such a
high risk of oil spillage and other environmental damages. Also, with the rise of more efficient
clean energy and the current climate crisis, it feels backwards and outdated to be investing
in fossil fuels when there are more sustainable alternatives. I hope BOEM takes California’s
aspirations of moving away from oil and protecting our coast seriously, and we keep the
Pacific OCS out of this leasing plan. We should really be thinking about the future of our
planet, and that entails clean energy, not drilling.
