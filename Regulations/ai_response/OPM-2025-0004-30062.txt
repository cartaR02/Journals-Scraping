**Retired Civil Servant Voices Concerns Over Proposed Rule Changes in Civil Service**

A retired civil servant has expressed reservations about a proposed rule from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management regarding performance accountability in the civil service. Nancy O. Webb, who devoted 40 years to the Social Security Administration, argues that the changes could deter talented individuals from applying for critical policy positions.

Webb acknowledges the need for new guidelines, stating, "I can understand and appreciate why the administration has proposed new rules to ensure that it can rely upon agencies to develop and implement policies to support their priorities." However, she emphasizes that the current provisions could be misused, potentially discouraging skilled professionals from entering the civil service.

The retired employee recommends a more focused approach to the proposed rule. She suggests limiting the number of positions affected by the changes. “The reality is that Senior Executives and Senior Managers (GS 14s and 15s) have the ultimate responsibility to develop and implement policy,” Webb asserts. She believes that expanding the provisions down to lower levels may dissuade capable candidates from pursuing policy roles, which she considers essential for maintaining a strong civil service.

To enhance accountability, Webb advocates for requiring senior policy leaders to include specific deliverables tied to administrative priorities in their performance plans. “This will ensure that senior leaders are held accountable for developing and implementing critical new policies,” she notes, indicating a desire to strengthen management responsibilities without undermining staff morale.

Webb further urges that a rethink of the new Schedule F classification may be needed. She suggests removing lower-level staff from the bargaining unit to grant managers additional flexibility in fulfilling the administration's initiatives. 

In conclusion, Webb expresses gratitude for the chance to provide feedback, noting that questions regarding her comments can be directed to her email at nancyos@aol.com. The letter was sent to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on September 30, 2023.


INPUT: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, 752
OPM Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004
Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service
Individual Comments:
I am a retired civil servant with 40 years of service at the Social Security Administration. I held
positions adjudicating disability claims, leading the effort to eliminate paper from the disability
claims process, and as a member of the Senior Executive Service in Policy and Adjudication
components.
I can understand and appreciate why the administration has proposed new rules to ensure that
it can rely upon agencies to develop and implement policies to support their priorities.
However, the way that the rule reads, the provisions could be abused and deter the best and
brightest individuals from entering civil service.
I recommend that the provisions be narrowed to:
• Limit the number of positions covered by these provisions. The reality is that Senior
Executives and Senior Managers (GS 14s and 15s) have the ultimate responsibility to
develop and implement policy. Their job is to lead their staff, set guidelines and hold
their employees accountable. Extending the provisions to lower levels could discourage
individuals from applying for policy positions. We need the best and brightest
employees in policy positions and they are likely to shy away from these positions
without Civil Service protections.
• OPM already has effective means to ensure that senior managers are held accountable
for critical deliverables. The new rule should require policy leaders at the senior level to
include specific deliverables regarding administration priorities in their performance
plans. This will ensure that senior leaders are held accountable for developing and
implementing critical new policies.
• Managers must ensure that staff performs the necessary work to support the mission.
Managers must hold their staff accountable so that they can meet the metrics in their
performance plan. Rather than including lower-level staff in the new Schedule F
classification, perhaps it would be advisable to remove those positions from the
bargaining unit and give their managers additional flexibility as they implement the
administration’s priorities.
Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the proposed rule. Any questions
can be directed to nancyos@aol.com.
