**Federal Agency Receives Strong Opposition to 11th OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program**

In a bold letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, B. Long, a Talkeetna, Alaska resident, voiced strong disapproval of the proposed 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. Long argues that the existing 10th program, effective since July 1, 2024, is sufficient and should not be replaced with an additional leasing program.

“This proposed 11th National OCS schedule should NOT happen. The United States has a perfectly good 10th National OCS Program that went into effect in 2024," Long expressed. "Having an additional program is unnecessary. It is an administrative political decision.”

Long further criticized the motivations behind the proposal, dismissing claims of an “energy emergency” as a guise for expanding federal leasing. “There is no energy emergency. America produces the most oil and gas annually; it is one of the largest exporters of refined petroleum products." 

Citing statistics from the Bureau of Land Management, Long pointed out that the resource industry currently has over 6,900 federal leases with approved oil and gas permits available to drill, most of which remain untapped. "The oil and gas industry only gets 11-12% of product from federal lands and water. Most of the products are from private property,” Long noted, emphasizing that the industry often buys leases merely to inflate balance sheets rather than pursuing actual drilling.

In the letter, the writer also addressed environmental concerns tied to increased leasing, stressing the need for comprehensive environmental analysis. “Without analysis of alternatives, environmentally sensitive area impacts won’t be considered responsibly,” Long stated. "The Arctic holds unparalleled ecological and cultural values, which would be threatened by drilling expansions."

Long further highlighted various regions, including the North Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area, emphasizing their ecological significance and calling for their exclusion from leasing initiatives. “A vigorous tribal consultation process must be initiated to ensure Tribal Self-Determination for decisions in the area,” Long explained.

The letter was submitted to the Bureau on May 25, 2025. It was addressed to Ms. Kelly Hammerle, Project Manager, National Oil and Gas Leasing Program, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

1. This proposed 11th National OCS Schedule should NOT happen. The United
States has a perfectly good 10th National OCS Program 2024-2029 that went into
effect 7/1/2024. I commented on that process. Having an additional program is
unnecessary. It is an administrative political decision. The 10th OCS Program
should not be replaced.
• The impetus behind this is under the guise of an “energy emergency”
which is merely a political action to try to get more leasing of federal public
waters. IT REPRESENTS A TAKING OF OUR PUBLIC WATERS.
America has plenty of energy to meet our nation’s needs.
• The data is not there to back up that there is an emergency. No energy
emergency exists. America has already achieved energy dominance in
the world. If a country is top dog, there is no emergency. America
achieved global energy dominance under the Obama administration.
America produces the most oil and gas annually. It is one of the largest
exporters of refined petroleum products.
• According to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), there are 6903
federal leases with approved oil and gas permits that are available to drill.
They are sitting idle. Thus, we do NOT need this aggressive OCS program
at all. 23 million acres of BLM public lands are under lease. Of that 12.4
million acres are producing economic quantities since FY 2022. That is
89,000 wells on 23,500 producing leases.
The US oil and gas industry only gets 11-12% of product from federal
lands and water. Most of the products are from private property.
Accelerated permitting programs are unlikely to have much influence on
the overall oil and gas production or consumer fuel prices.
• The unused federal leases are due to global market conditions. New oil
drilling is just not profitable unless oil is $70 a barrel. The oil and gas
industry often just buys leases to inflate their balance sheets. They flip
leases to other companies rather than drilling for fuel.
• Wall street shareholders, banks, and insurance companies are now
demanding more actual profit from oil and hydraulic fracturing companies.
The oil and gas companies are under pressure to deliver returns to
investors.

• These same insurance companies, banks and even oil industry executives
have publicly cautioned against the practicality and necessity of additional
leasing.
2. The Draft Proposal Program (DPP) Process Comments:
• BOEM states that following NEPA is “unripe” at this stage according to 2
Supreme Court cases. I do NOT agree. There needs to be a
programmatic EIS done instead of a stand-alone environmental
analysis document with no alternatives. This is the largest single
expansion of leasing ever proposed.
• This is especially true considering the nominations of new areas. Without
analysis of alternatives , environmentally sensitive area impacts won’t be
considered responsibly. All the Arctic Planning areas hold unparalleled
ecological and cultural values. The oil and gas drilling expansions threaten
to destroy what makes the area so vital to America and worldwide. The
Arctic has a key role in regulating climate world-wide.
• BOEM’s preparation of cost/benefit analysis must be appropriate for the
coastal zone and infrastructure. The Beaufort, Chukchi and North Bering
Seas provide habitat for irreplaceable wildlife that are central to life and
food security for coastal communities. The unique characteristics of the
Arctic marine environment make resource extraction particularly difficult
and dangerous. This makes new leasing unwise in these Arctic waters.
• The DPP needs to show that there is a market demand for leasing in
Alaskan waters and that the petroleum industry is interested in the
expanded leasing. The BOEM website lists industry interest in leasing
programs as an important aspect of BOEM’s comments to develop the
programmatic EIS. Where is the data for that statement? It has not been proven
that there is industry interest in lease sales off the Alaska coasts or for that matter
90% of the US coastal waters.
3. Protected Areas to be excluded from OCS leasing
• North Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area: This area was protected by
Executive Order 13754 by both the Obama and Biden Administrations. I
do not know if the current administration has rescinded the EO. This
291,000 square kilometer area supports one of the largest marine
mammal migrations in the world. It is the home area to more than 40
coastal tribes. A vigorous tribal consultation process must be initiated to
ensure Tribal Self-Determination for the decisions in the area. A task force
of Bering Sea residents exists to inform federal decision making. These
voices should not be silenced.
• North Aleutian Basin Planning Area: This area was restricted on
12/16/2014 under Section 12(a) of the OCS Land Act. The reasons were
the importance of natural resources for subsistence use by Alaskan
natives and the important resources of wildlife and their habitat and
sustainable commercial and recreation facilities.
• Exclusion Areas from Beaufort Sea Leasing to be Considered in the EIS
2
RFI 11th OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program
These withdrawal areas will serve as a refuge and will protect interconnected components of
ecosystems including Ecologically Important Areas, and the migration pathways between them.
Potential shifts in critical habitat will occur in the face of climate change, and this must be
considered. Subsistence resources and activities are an integral part of the communities. Human
health and culture are dependent on a subsistence way of life. These exclusion areas may
overlap. The following areas were supported in the April 2018 Call for Information and
Nominations by the Marine Mammal Commission and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
And they are still relevant in 2025.
a. The Barrow and Kaktovik Whaling Areas:
b. Entire Barrow Canyon: This canyon extends from within the Chukchi Sea Lease
area into the Beaufort Sea Lease area at Point Barrow. The whole area must be
exempt, which includes also east of the canyon and inside the 20-m isobaths north
of Elson Lagoon barrier islands. This is an important migratory and foraging area
for Beluga, bowhead and gray whales and many high-density bird species. It
encompasses areas of high benthic biomass and high productivity. This important
feeding habitat for bowheads is due to wind induced upwelling that brings prey
species in the late summer. “Krill trap” events occur at the convergence of the
Alaska coastal current and the Beaufort Sea shelf current.
c. Cross Island Subsistence Use Area: Area east of Cross Island to Tigvariak Island
and seaward to barrier islands out to 40-m isobaths. To Nuiqsut residents, the
bowhead whale is a major subsistence resource. They launch their hunt from base
camp approximately 100 miles from town on Cross Island. This is close to the
migration path and is the traditional place used for whaling activities. They
deploy from the island and hunt in the marine environment between Kuparuk and
Canning Rivers
d. Camden Bay Feeding and Resting Area: Area extending seaward to 20-m
isobaths. This is an important foraging and resting habitat for bowhead, Beluga,
and gray whales, ringed, bearded and spotted seals, walrus, and orcas. This
statement is supported by aerial surveys. This area is significant for subsistence
hunting.
e. Barrow Subsistence Use Area: These areas should extend east from Pt. Barrow
toward Admiralty Bay and further east to wedge of Smith Bay and seaward to 50-
m isobaths.
f. Kaktovik Subsistence Use Area: east of Kaktovik to 142 degrees longitude and
seaward 50-m isobaths. This area is important for bowhead whale and important
for long term high bird density populations such as brant geese and red-throated
loon. It is also an important polar bear denning area.
g. The National Marine Fisheries Service identified Biologically Important Areas:
Bowhead Fall and Summer areas and Beluga Summer. These are shown from
Attachment 3 in BF 2019 Area ID
.
• Cook Inlet: The critical Habitat of the Federal Endangered Beluga whale and sea
otters must be off limits.

4. In the National OCS Plan, Exclusion of Cook Inlet, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea and High
Arctic Regions due to Environmental and Social Impacts is Necessary.
BOEM’s mission is not only to lease OCS public resources for oil and gas extraction. BOEM’s
important mission is the stewardship and protection of OCS resources.
Cook Inlet
The federal government itself has estimated that there is a 72% chance of a large oil spill
occurring in Cook Inlet. This has been downplayed by BOEM. There is no viable technology to
successfully respond to a spill in the highly dynamic Cook Inlet waters. The winter of
2016/2017, Hillcorp’s natural gas pipeline in the Inlet was leaking for over three months before it
was fixed. Hillcorp said that they couldn’t get to it because of the ice and the winter weather.
Cook Inlet is the only coastal waterbody in the US where oil and gas producers legally dump up
to 2 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the Inlet. It is the only major port in the western
hemisphere where no tugboat vessel service is used with adequately equipped resources. For
BOEM OCS leasing this reality must change.
Dispersants will cause long term ecological harm to fisheries. They are not an option. BOEM
must conduct realistic oil spill and response analysis. Also what must be analyzed is
navigational safety issues, the lack of tug escorts for tankers, the presence of fisheries drift gear
and vessels, the tide and weather related natural Cook Inlet conditions, effects of seismic
activity, worst case scenarios for all land and water with special attention to protected areas and
cumulative effects on the Cook Inlet Beluga Whale populations which are listed as depleted
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and endangered under the Endangered Species Act.
Oil and gas leasing displaces the opportunity to produce renewable offshore energy power
supplies. Cook Inlet has the second highest tides in North America. Prolific wind and solar
potential abound.
Beaufort, Chukchi and High Arctic
Loss of sea ice, the acidification of oceans and increased access for industrial uses all pose
significant risks to the area. BOEM must protect the diverse habitat for wildlife during critical
life stages and productivity. BOEM must sustain the resilience of the Arctic ecosystem like the
long migration routes for seabirds and bowhead whales, foraging hotspots, subsistence use areas,
rich seafloor habitat, lingering ice habitats and areas where algae and phytoplankton thrive.
The oil industry is already experiencing climate- change impacts in the Beaufort Sea area which
affect their plans. Climate change will slow down many companies plans to drill and produce.
The shrinking and thinning sea ice is a main cause.
NOAA’s 2024 Arctic Report Card data shows that the arctic is warming 3 to 4 times faster than
the global mean since 1980. This is the 11th year that arctic temperature anomalies are higher
than the global average. The extent of thicker old sea ice has remained low since 2007. The
arctic is now a “new regime”.

RFI 11th OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program
Businesses that rely upon shoreline ice for drilling platforms will likely face significant
challenges/
Scientists say that a primary concern from oil companies is that the window to work on sea ice is
shrinking. From 1973 to 2008, satellite data has shown the duration of sea ice extent shrank by 7
weeks. Scientists are seeing in the Beaufort Sea that the waves are getting bigger and bigger.
They are modeling wave height, storm surges, coastal erosion, and how that will change the
coast. Oil companies might have to plan for increasing erosion around pipelines due to higher
wave conditions. Bigger boars and dredging might have to be included in the plans.
5. The Public Faith in Federal Regulators to Protect the Environment is very low. The
Current Administration Plans to Rewrite or Deregulate Important Rules…that is the
cause.
The current administration has fired and muzzled scientists and policy experts in the federal
agencies involved in oil and gas leases on public lands and waters. This means an abandonment
of the missions of the federal agencies. Every regulatory requirement removed from the oil and
gas industry ends up falling on the public to clean up the pollution of land, water, and air that
impacts marine life, wildlife and people.
The scientific consensus is that the US is unprepared and unable to clean up oil and gas spill in
the arctic. With the regulatory rollbacks being proposed by the current administration, the public
has zero faith in preventing negative impacts from oil and gas drilling. The following proposed
regulatory rewrites are on regulations that were scientifically vetted and supported by the public
in the lengthy public process.
• The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement promulgated the OCS Production
Systems Rule and the OCS Blowout Prevention Systems and Well Control Rule.
These rules require blowout prevention devices and the well control requirements of well
design, control, casing, cementing, monitoring of subsea containment, safety environmental
management systems and emergency blowout response plans. The rules were promulgated in
2019 and revised in 2023. These rules should be kept. The public wants no relaxations of drilling
safeguards especially in the arctic.
• Methane Waste Prevention Rule
The regs are flexible, cost effective and proven to work. They would reduce the amount of
methane and volatile organic compounds such as benzene and hydrogen sulfide which cause
chronic and acute health effects, during exploration, production and transportation. We want a
near zero tolerance for methane waste to safeguard the public interest. On the plus side,
preventing these emissions means an increase of royalty revenues to the federal government by
preventing leaks. The Rule was finalized on 11/12/2024. On 2/14/25, the Eighth Circuit Court
granted a motion to hold the rule in abeyance.
• The National Contingency Plan/National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution
Contingency Plan: This is the federal government framework for oil and gas spill
5
RFI 11th OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program
response and for hazardous substances releases. The Plan was finalized in 1994 although
subpart J, the use of chemicals and bio agents for oil spills, was finalized in 2021 and
2023. The bulk of this Plan should be updated.
• Reduced Federal Agency Oversight –Zero Public Confidence in Environmental
Protection
The staff firings and cuts to federal agencies such as EPA, NOAA, NASA, Interior Department
itself, means reduced agency oversight. In fact, the current administration is changing the whole
federal system. There will be deep cuts in agency budgets. An enforcement agency can’t run
without managers. EPA will end up reversing a whole generation of environmental protections.
Already EPA data reveals dramatic decreases in enforcement and polluter fees. This includes a
drop in agency actions on injunction relief which is the monetary commitment to remediate
pollution and to stop it from recurring. The drop in prosecution and litigation means lasting
consequences for the environment.
