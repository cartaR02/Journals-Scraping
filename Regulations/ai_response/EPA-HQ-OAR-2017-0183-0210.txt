**EPA Receives MACT Compliance Performance Insights from Alpha-Gamma Technologies**

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) was recently provided with a comprehensive memorandum detailing the performance data for maximum achievable control technology (MACT) applied to large municipal waste combustors (MWCs). This submission was made by Bradley Nelson and Can Kuterdem from Alpha-Gamma Technologies, Inc. 

“We are pleased to report that the performance of MACT retrofits has been outstanding,” stated Nelson. The memorandum summarizes critical test data from 167 large MWC units in compliance with emission guidelines established under Section 129 of the Clean Air Act. These guidelines mandated the retrofit of emission control technologies by December 2000.

The memorandum highlights various data points, including frequency distributions, statistical analyses, and emission factors. Specifically, it breaks down performance metrics on pollutants such as dioxins, mercury, cadmium, and particulate matter, asserting their compliance with the established emission limits.

Kuterdem added, “The data presented illustrate a robust correlation between the MACT performance and the subpart Cb emission guidelines, providing assurance of our compliance and the effectiveness of our technologies.” The analysis utilized detailed statistical tools and categorized stack test results into comprehensive tables and plots, facilitating a clearer understanding of emission trends.

The memorandum also outlines significant variations and trends observed in emission factors across different types of MWCs and air pollution control devices. Included is a detailed analysis of the various configurations used, which further underscores the importance of specific technology combinations in achieving optimal performance.

In closing, it is noted that the memorandum was sent on June 18, 2002, to Walt Stevenson, who represents the U.S. EPA's Emission Standards Division's Combustion Group. Bradley Nelson and Can Kuterdem signed the letter, emphasizing a continued commitment to environmental standards and compliance efforts in waste management technologies.

MEMORANDUM
DATE: June 18,2002
SUBJECT: Performance / Test Data for Large Municipal Waste Com
MACT Compliance (Year 2000 data)
FROM: Bradley Nelson
Can Kuterdem
Alpha-Gamma Tiechnologies,Inc.
TO: Walt Stevenson, EPA/Emission Standards DivisiodCombustion Group
This memorandum summarizes the performance of maximum achievable control
technology (MACT) at large muinicipal waste combustor (MWC) units. The retrofit of MACT
was required by emission guidelines established under Section 129 of the Clean Air Act. The
guidelines for large MWCs were adopted in 1995 under 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cb, and
required emission control retrofit by December 2000. This memorandum is a companion to two
other memoranda. First, it is a companion to the memorandum "Emissions from Large Municipal
Waste Combustion Units (MWCs) Following MACT Retrofit (year 2000 test data)" Docket A­
90-45; Item VIII-B-3. That memorandum presents annual emissions from large MWC units and
is based on the stack test data discussed in this memorandum. Second, it is a companion to the
memorandum ''Lee County MWC Emissions Variability Analysis" Docket A-90-45 ;Item WI-
B-10. That memorandum reviews the year-to-year emissions variability that occurs at an MWC.
The Lee County MWC was equipped with MACT at start up in 1994 and test data was obtained
for all years since start-up. The L,ee County analysis is useful when reviewing the variation in
MACT retrofit performance observed at the 167 large MWCs.
1
Following MACT retriofit in December 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(U.S. EPA) obtained stack test reports fi-om all 167 large MWC units. The data in the stack test
reports have been compiled arid presented in tables, plots and statistical figures in this
memorandum. The data are arranged as:
(1) Frequency distributions of test data
(2) Data plots and :statistics
(3) Emission factors
(4) Parameter ratios
(5) MWC Inventory and date of stack test
(6) Subpart Cb Emission Guidelines - Summary
At the end of this memorandum, Tables 1,2,3 and 4present general summaries oft he
test data and analysis. More detailed information can be found in Attachments 1 through 6.
Attachment 1- Frequency distributions of test data
Attachment 1 presents MACT performance data for all Section 129 pollutants including;
dioxidhrans (CDDICDF), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), particulate matter (PM[),
hydrochloric acid (HCI), sulfur dioxide (SO?), and nitrous oxides (NO,). Two formats of data are
presented for CDD/CDF and SO2. For CDD/CDF, data are presented in both a total mass basis
and toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) basis. The total mass basis can be used to compare M.ACT
performance with the subpart Cb emission guidelines and the TEQ basis data can be used for both
TEQ emissions calculations and for comparison with permits drafted in a TEQ format. For SO2,
data are presented in both an arithmetic average basis and a geometric mean basis. The geometric
mean basis can be used to compare performance with the subpart Cb emission guidelines, and the
arithmetic average basis used folr both calculating annual emissions and for developing emission
factors. In presenting the perfoImance of the MACT retrofits, a frequency analysis was
performed using the histogram utility of EXCEL. The stack test results from the 167 MWC units
2
were categorized under 13 bin ranges. Depending on the maximum and minimum values, the
limits on the bins are varied. Table 1 presents the mean (average) performance of the 167 MACT
retrofits. The performance of MACT retrofits has been outstanding.
Attachment 2 -Data plots and statistics
Attachment 2 presents various data plots and statistics on MACT performance. The
information is subdivided by MWC type and air pollution control device (APCD) combination.
Appendix 2 also presents infonnation on the APCD used for MACT retrofit. The most common
configuration was spray dryerifabric filter (SDiFF) and it was used at 138 of the 167 MWCs.
Table 2 presents a summary of APCD used.
Attachment 3 -Emission factors
This attachment presents emission factors for various MWC /APCD combinations. 'The
emission factors were calculated using the stack test data. First, the stack test data was used to
calculate annual emissions, then this was divided by the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW)
fired during the year, The emission factors are presented in dimensional units of emissions (kg) per
unit of waste fired (Mg). Table 3 presents a summary of emission factors developed.. In most
cases these emission factors are similar to current AP-42 emission factors but some (e.g. mercury)
are noticeably different (lower).
Attachment 4-Parameter ratios
This attachment presents pollutant and process ratios calculated from the collected MWC
unit data. The calculated ratios are;
CDDiCDF total mass basis versus TEQ basis
0
s SO, geometric mean versus SO, arithmetic average
3
a Flue gas flow rate versus municipal waste fired
a Annual municipal waste combusted versus unit capacity
a Steam generation versus municipal waste combusted
Linear regression analysis was camed out by the least squares method and a straight line
was fitted onto the data by EXCEL'S regression utility. The slope of the line represents the ratio
for the aforementioned relationships. Table 4 presents the various ratios calculated from the data.
As show in the table, the CDDKDF total mass / TEQ ratio was 51.1 : 1 and the annual capacity
factor was 85 percent.
Attachment 5 -MWC Inventorv and date of stack test
This attachment lists the 167 MWC units in the large MWC category. It includes data on
MWC location, type, size, and APCD used. It also lists the date of the stack test used in this
analysis.
Attachment 6 -Subpart Cb Emission Guidelines - Summaw
Attachment 6 presents a summary of the 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Cb emission guidelines.
When these guidelines were adopted in 1995 they applied to both large and small MWC units, but
were amended in 1997 to apply only to MWC units with individual unit combustion capacity
greater than 250 tons per day (large MWC units). The final guidelines applied to 167 large MWC
units.

Note (b): Emissions data from the Lacrosse (French Island) MWC was not included in this
Attachment or Attachment 2 because post MACT test data was not available. Approximately
three months before the MACT compliance date of December 2000, a re-evaluation of the
capacity of this MWC moved it from the small MWC category (2005 MACT compliance date) to
the large MWC category. The LaCrosse MWC was put on an accelerated retrofit program that
completes retrofit in 2002, but stack testing was not completed at this time.

TAELE3. SUMMARY OF GUIDELINESFOR EXISTINGMWC'S (SUBPART CE).'
I'indicates a significant change since proposal and the change is discussed in this preamble]
Applicability
The final guidelines apply to existing MWCs located at plants with ca­
pacities to combust greater than 35 Muday of residential. commer­
cial. andlor institutional discards. Industrial minufacturing discards
are not covered by the guidelines. Any medical. industrial manufac­
turing. municipal. or other type of waste combustor plant with capac­
ity to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW and with a federally
enforceable permit to combust less than 10 Mglday of MSW is not
covered.'
Plant Size (MSW combustion capacity) Requirement

> 35 Mglday but 225 Mglday (referred to as small MWC plants) ......... Subject to provisions listed below.
> 225 Mglday (referred to as large MWC plants) .................................... Subject to provisions listed below.
Good Combustion Practices
Applies to large and small MWC plants.
A site-specific operator training manual is required to be developed and made available for MWC personnel.
The EPA or a State MWC operator training course would be required to be completed by the MWC chief facility operator, shift supervisors.
and control room operators.
The ASME (or State-equivalent)provisional and full operator certification must be obtained by the MWC chief facility operator (mandatory).
shift supervisors (mandatory). and control room 'operators (optional).'
The MWC load level is required to be measured and not to exceed 110 percent of the maximum load level measured during the most recent
dioxin/furan performance test.
The maximum PM control device inlet flue gas temperature is required to be measured and not to exceed the temperature 17'C above the
maximum temperature measured during the most recent dioxinlfuran performance test.
The CO level is reauired to be measured usinq a CEMS. and the concentration in the flue gas is required not to exceed the following:

Compliance Schedule:
Laroe MWC Dlants
Stare plans are required to include one of the following three retrofit schedules for compliance with regulatory requirements: (1) Full compli­
ance or closure within 1 year following EPA approval of the State plan: (2) full compliance in 1 to 3 years following issuance of a revised
construction or operation permit if a permit modification is required or 1 to 3 years following EPA approval of the State plan if a permit
modification is not required. provided the Stale plan includes measurable and enforceable incremental steps of progress toward compli­
ance: or (3) closure in 1 to 3 years following approval of the State plan. provided the State plan includes a closure agreement. If a State
plan allows the second or third scheduling options (Le.. more than 1 year), the State plan submitted to EPA must contain post-'1990 test
data for dioxins/furansfor all MWC units at large plants under the extended schedule. (See S60.21(h) of subpart B of 40 CFR 60 for addi­
tional information relating to measurable and enforceable incremental steps of progress toward compliance).
Small MWC plants
State plans must require full compliance or closure with regulatory
requirements in 3 years or less following issuance of a revised
construction or operation permit if a permit modification is required,
or within 3 years following EPA approval of the State plan if a per­
mit modification is not required.
State plans are required to specify that all MWC,'s at large MWC plants for which construction was commenced after June 26. 1987 comply
with the guidelines for Hg and dioxinslfurans within 1 year following issuance of a revised construction or operation permit if a perrnit modi­
fication is required. or within 1 year following EPA approval of the State plan. whichever is later.
I
State plans are required to specify that owners or operators of
MWC's comply with the operator training and certification require­
ments by 6 months after startup or 1 year after State plan approval
by the EPA. whichever is later. for large plants and by 6 months afler

!.State plans may allow NOx emissions averaging between existing MWC units at a large MWC plant. The daily weighted average NOx emis­
sions concentration from the MWC units included in the emissions averaging plan must comply with the following 24-hour limits: 180 ppmv for
mass burn waterwall combustors; 220 ppmv for mass bum rotary waterwall combustors: 230 ppmv for refuse-derivedfuel combustors: 220 ppmv
for fluidized bed combustors: and 180 ppmv for othier combustor types (excluding mass burn refractory combustors), Refer to the regulatory text
of the emission guideiines for additional requirements. State plans may also establish a program to allow emissions trading between non-contig­
uous MWC plants. Such a program shall meet the requirements of the Open Market Trading Rule of Ozone Smog Precursors. proposed August

Although not part of the dioxinlfuran limit. the dioxin/furan total mass limits of 30 ngldscm. 60 ng/dscm. and 125 ng/dscm are equal to about
0.3 to 0.8ngldscm TEQ. 0.7 to 1.4 ngldscm TEQ. and 1.7 to 2.9 ng/dscm TEQ. respectively. The optional reduced testing limits of 15 ngldscm
and 30 ngdscm total mass are equal to about 0.1 to 0.3 ng/dscm TEQ and 0.3 to 0.8 ng/dscm TEQ. respectively.
