**Student Voices Concerns Over Proposed Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Program**

In a letter addressed to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Gretta Callison has expressed her opposition to the proposed National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. As a student and concerned citizen residing near the Pacific coast, Callison's firsthand experiences with the marine environment fundamentally shape her stance on the potential risks associated with offshore oil and gas development.

Callison emphasizes the dangers posed by the expansion of oil and gas leasing, stating, "The expansion of oil and gas leasing in the OCS threatens sensitive marine ecosystems, public health, and the progress we’ve made toward clean energy." She highlights past disasters, noting, "As seen in past disasters like the Deepwater Horizon spill, even a single incident can cause irreversible damage."

The letter argues that continued investment in fossil fuels undermines climate change mitigation efforts. "Scientific consensus tells us that to avoid the worst climate impacts, we must phase out fossil fuel expansion, not expand it," Callison states. She cites the International Energy Agency, asserting that "no new oil and gas development is compatible with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C."

Describing her connection to the coastal community, Callison notes, "Living in a coastal region, I’ve witnessed firsthand the importance of healthy oceans for tourism, cultural identity, and economic livelihoods. Offshore drilling puts all of this at risk." She emphasizes that young people and future generations will suffer the consequences of increased emissions and climate instability linked to fossil fuel extraction.

Callison outlines a series of recommendations aimed at addressing her concerns. She urges BOEM to exclude new leasing areas in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans from the final plan, accelerate the transition to renewable energy, conduct thorough environmental assessments, and protect vital marine ecosystems and cultural heritage sites.

Her closing remarks are a call to action: "Our future depends on decisive action now to protect our coasts, invest in clean energy, and fight climate change." She argues that the risks to ecosystems and communities greatly exceed any short-term economic benefits that may arise from drilling.

The letter was sent to BOEM on May 14, 2025, with Gretta Callison as the sole signer.

To whom it may concern,
As a student and concerned citizen, I am submitting this comment in response to the proposed
National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. I am writing because I
am directly affected by the decisions made regarding offshore oil and gas
development—especially as someone who lives near the Pacific coast and relies on a healthy
marine environment for clean air, recreation, and climate stability.
The expansion of oil and gas leasing in the OCS threatens sensitive marine ecosystems,
public health, and the progress we’ve made toward clean energy. Offshore drilling increases the
risk of oil spills, which can have devastating and long-lasting effects on marine wildlife,
fisheries, and coastal communities. As seen in past disasters like the Deepwater Horizon spill,
even a single incident can cause irreversible damage.
Furthermore, continued investment in fossil fuel infrastructure undercuts efforts to
mitigate climate change. Scientific consensus tells us that to avoid the worst climate impacts, we
must phase out fossil fuel expansion, not expand it. The International Energy Agency has stated
that no new oil and gas development is compatible with the goal of limiting global warming to
1.5°C.
Living in a coastal region, I’ve witnessed firsthand the importance of healthy oceans for
tourism, cultural identity, and economic livelihoods. Offshore drilling puts all of this at risk. In
addition, communities like mine—particularly young people and future generations—will bear
the brunt of increased emissions and climate instability caused by expanded fossil fuel
extraction.
I strongly urge the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to:
1. Exclude new leasing areas in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans from the final
plan.
2. Accelerate the transition to renewable energy by prioritizing offshore wind and other
sustainable energy sources.
3. Conduct robust environmental justice and climate impact assessments to fully
understand who is affected and how.
4. Protect existing marine ecosystems and cultural heritage sites that are vital to
Indigenous and local communities.
As an interested and affected party, I urge you to halt the expansion of offshore oil and
gas leasing. Our future depends on decisive action now to protect our coasts, invest in clean
energy, and fight climate change. The risks to ecosystems and communities far outweigh any
short-term economic benefit from drilling.
Sincerely,
Gretta Callison
