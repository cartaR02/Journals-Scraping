**Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure Highlights Need for Improved State Dig Laws**

In a recently issued letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure emphasized the urgent need for improvements in state dig laws, which are essential for effective excavation and damage prevention practices. The organization expressed that current state regulations are inadequate in addressing critical practices needed to enhance safety and collaboration among industry stakeholders.

Benjamin Dierker, executive director of the Alliance, stated, “With excavation damage incidents reaching historical highs, it is imperative that lawmakers prioritize the adoption of modern technology and best practices in damage prevention laws. This Report Card is aimed at helping policymakers identify states that have effectively implemented such practices while shining a light on those lagging behind.”

Furthermore, the letter explained that advancements in technology, such as GPS and mobile applications, are not being adequately reflected in state regulations. Dierker remarked, “Every excavation poses potential risks not only to infrastructure but also to the safety of workers and the public. The time for state legislation to evolve with technology is now.” The organization noted particular concerns regarding white-lining and positive response practices, which are crucial for ensuring safe excavations.

The letter also highlighted findings that pointed to the staggering costs associated with excavation damages. According to their research, excavation damages from various underground utilities have cost the nation over $50 billion annually. Dierker urged lawmakers to consider these figures when formulating policies, adding, “Each new law that facilitates better communication between operators and excavators is a step toward reducing the risk of accidents and ultimately saving lives.”

The call to action included specific recommendations for states to modernize their damage prevention laws, including mandatory provisions for white-lining and enhanced communication through electronic positive response systems. The Alliance asserted that these improvements could significantly lower the incidents of excavation damages and promote overall safety.

The letter was sent to the U.S. Department of Transportation on September 15, 2024, addressing key individuals including the secretary of transportation and the chief of pipeline safety. The organization hopes this initiative will ignite discussions among policymakers and industry experts about the critical need for reform in damage prevention practices across the nation.

Introduction
Technology and law do not necessarily advance at the same rate. This is an inherent feature of
innovation, and a desirable quality in public policy. Laws that advance too far or fast may have
unintended consequences, lead to compliance issues, or may even undermine other
advancements in innovation. In damage prevention, like with many sectors, law and regulation
that set enforceable requirements should generally trail technology and best practices.
Modern technology has advanced such that many of the tools and software that once seemed
inaccessible due to scarcity or cost are now virtually ubiquitous. Smart phones, GPS, digital
photography, and more only scratch the surface of what the average person – including the
average excavator or other damage prevention stakeholder – has available to them. With
communication and collaboration at the heart of effective damage prevention, leveraging these
tools is essential.
As legislators, regulators, and policymakers consider reforms and updates to the laws impacting
damage prevention, they must evaluate what tools are available to stakeholders and how they
may align with proven best practices. But evaluation alone is not enough, they must act. While
the lag between innovation and policy can be beneficial, allowing technology to mature and
become more accessible, the time has come to use currently available technology in setting
minimum enforceable standards. With excavation damage trends rising and damage numbers at
historical highs, adopting these tools for most or all excavation projects is both achievable and
necessary.
This is the third edition of the Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure (Aii) Damage
Prevention Report Card. To provide the most value for industry leaders and policymakers in
damage prevention, we have refined our grading rubric to more effectively discern proactive
measures taken regarding state laws. We can report that there have been few substantive
improvements to state dig laws since our first Report Card in 2016. The laws and regulations of
many states continue to inadequately address certain basic practices or simply lack clarity, even
if One-Call centers have been more proactive. We intend this Report Card to serve as a resource
for state regulators, legislatures, and industry participants interested in adopting higher standards
for damage prevention and promoting best practices using available technology.

Background
Improving state dig laws can have enormous consequences. Not only does excavation pose direct
risks to infrastructure reliability, economic well-being, and environmental health, but the most
fundamental risk is to worker safety. While damage prevention emphasizes the infrastructure
itself, the focus of the industry is often referred to as excavation safety, emphasizing that every
excavation can put excavators, construction workers, and the public at risk of death or serious
injury. It is incumbent on public policymakers to ensure safety and prevent broader cascading
effects from service disruptions and construction delays. Ensuring high-quality information
sharing, communication, and collaboration is a fundamental step.1
According to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), 639
excavation damages across all pipeline categories resulted in 136 deaths or injuries and cost over
$410 million in damage over the past ten years (from 2014-2023).2 Narrowing to only excavation
damage from gas distribution lines, which connect resources to end users and often are located in
densely populated areas, preventable excavation damage resulted in 377 incidents, 12 fatalities,
84 injuries, and over $176 million in reported costs during the same period.3
Excavation incidents that damage water, sewer, cable, broadband, or electric utility lines are not
included in the PHSMA analysis, and can also cause death, significant injury, and economic
harm. The 2019 Damage Information Reporting Tool (DIRT) Report from the Common Ground
Alliance (CGA) estimated that the societal impact of all excavation damages was $30 billion that
year.4 Other estimates place total annual nationwide excavation damages even higher, between
$50 billion and $100 billion every year.5 With new historic highs in excavation damage incidents
in three out of the four years since that report, along with compounding factors like inflation, the
total annual economic harm is certain to be higher.
Among a number of findings from a 2017 PHMSA study, utilizing mapping technology and
Enhanced Positive Response (EPR) can reduce damage incidents during excavation by as much
as two thirds.6 Two Report Cards and eight years later, seemingly only one state has truly

adopted rules and procedures akin to EPR to ensure robust stakeholder communication and
collaboration and to enable the excavator to conduct on-site quality control. Likewise, despite
advances in mapping and digital platforms, in almost every state, excavator locate requests
continue to under-leverage available technology.
Rather than requiring the use of available and proven technology to facilitate high-quality
information sharing, including digital pre-marking and enhanced communication when marks are
complete, state laws have generally remained static. Most states currently require some variation
of the following steps in the locate process:
1) The excavator calls or logs into the state or regional One-Call center at least forty-
eight hours prior to beginning excavation;
2) The One-Call center notifies any operator with facilities impacted by the
excavation;
3) The facility operator, often through a third-party contract locator, marks the work
site with paint, stakes, or flags to signify the location of any underground facilities
within a required 48- to 72-hour period prior to scheduled excavation; and
4) The excavator breaks ground after the 48- to 72-hour waiting period has passed.
Although some states have enhanced the procedure above by leveraging available technology to
facilitate improved communication between parties, more can be done. Online communication
can improve collaboration and lead to safer outcomes by allowing excavators and operators to
cross reference information. Increasing shareability of information and accessibility is an
effective way to decrease costly accidents that harm excavators, operators, and the public. We
created the Report Card to help track which states, through laws and regulations, require the use
of better practices and technologies that can improve communication and enable quality-control
measures that can reduce excavation damages.
In past Report Cards, we have rated only elements of enhanced positive response. This year, we
have added an assessment of white-lining to the Report Card (both physical and virtual white-
lining). That is the excavator’s markings before they dig to signal to utility operators and locators
the precise boundaries they intend to excavate. Mandatory white-lining improves excavation
outcomes and is widely supported in the industry, with many states including a requirement to
pre-mark in their laws. However, some states do not address white-lining at all, while others only
require white-lining at the request of the locator or leave it to the discretion of the excavator.
White-lining is generally the best way to communicate the dimensions of the excavation site, and
provides more precise information for locators leading to fewer accidents. The legislative or
regulatory treatment of electronic white-lining, preferred by many excavators, is also tracked by
Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 3
state in this Report Card. We have also included Chicago and Washington, D.C. as special
districts with distinct damage prevention practices worthy of review.
The objective for every state should be the same: implementing proactive and innovative damage
prevention requirements that decrease the potential for damages. The Report Card allows
policymakers to see a range of regulations and practical examples of damage prevention
provisions to consider for adoption.
The Report Card analysis is focused on two consensus best practices identified by the industry,
government, and third-party reports: white-lining and positive response.7 We treat those as
categories and include the more basic forms along with technology-based evolutions to white-
lining and positive response. We have noted for years, as an independent third-party observer,
the slow progress to see systemic adoption of these practices and the use of available technology
to enhance their application.8 According to CGA in its 2021 Technology Report, the optimal
excavation project in 2030 should be far more streamlined:
An Idealized Excavation Project in the Year 2030
Technology can help transform the damage prevention process, and this
section of the Report imagines how an excavation project might unfold in the
year 2030 by incorporating technological concepts from CGA Technology
Report case studies as well as issues and processes brought to the forefront in
the Next Practices Report and Locator White Paper, such as electronic white-
lining, GIS-based mapping, enhanced positive response and better
communication between excavators and locators/facility operators.
Imagine an excavation project with the following elements:
1. Excavator enters an electronic one call ticket using electronic white-
lining.
2. Facility operators/locators respond by marking the site on time and
providing an Enhanced Positive Response (EPR). The EPR includes a
unique digital file (with a password or QR code) linked to the one call
ticket number. The file contains information such as maps/coordinates,
photographs, special instructions, etc.9

With all 16 stakeholder groups comprising CGA unanimously agreeing10 to list these as best
practices and agreeing that by 2030, the ideal dig might start with electronic white-lining and go
directly into an enhanced positive response, our Report Card asks basic questions of state laws to
identify states’ readiness to achieve this ideal dig under current laws and regulations.11

Reading The Report Card
The Report Card is based on an analysis of every state’s damage prevention statute, as well as
any implementing regulations. Where we have deemed relevant, we have also discussed in our
analysis information on technological best practices offered by the various One-Call centers.12
However, the Report Card is focused on the laws and regulations of each state. In certain
instances, a state’s legal requirement points to the One-Call center procedures, requiring review
of those centers in connection with our grading of the state. Additionally, while the Report Card
rates the state laws for their handling of certain practices and technologies, in our analysis below,
we note which of the reviewed technologies One-Call centers may be adopting or able to adopt
themselves and offer to stakeholders voluntarily even without legal requirements to do so.
The Report Card employs this key to evaluate each best practice from the Aii Table 1 below:

White-Lining
In this section, we review state laws in their handling of the excavators’ pre-marking of the
excavation site. The two approaches to pre-marking are physical white-lining, such as with paint,
stakes, or flags, and electronic white-lining by using a mapping platform on the One-Call center
website. While state law can require one or both of these practices, electronic white-lining is a
technology-based practice that One-Call centers can take the lead in developing and offering
irrespective of state laws.
Physical White-Lining
Does the state require the excavator to make any physical pre-marking of the excavation area?
We have defined white-lining as a requirement of the excavator to clearly mark, delineate, or
“white-line” the excavation site prior to notifying the One-Call center.13 To meet our criteria for
white-lining, pre-marking must be required before alerting the One-Call center (or before
locators arrive) and be mandatory except in certain limited circumstances.
White-lining only at the request of an operator would not meet our criteria. Marking only where
further clarification is needed would not meet our criteria. However, an alternative requirement
for an in-person onsite meeting between excavator and operator prior to locating services would
satisfy the criteria, possibly providing more information and communication than a pre-mark.14
Clearly defining the area of excavation helps prevent miscommunication that could otherwise
result in damages and delays, while offering facility operators and locators a narrower area to
concentrate their locating - even if they must still locate and mark an entire property.
As seen in the Report Card, 18 states have white-lining requirements that meet our definition:
Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa,15 Maine, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico,16 Ohio, Oregon,17 Rhode
Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wyoming
In the last four years, 12 states have updated or amended the white-lining section of their dig
laws.18
13 Or in conjunction with such notification before the utility owner/operator or locator visits the site.
14 We considered “white-lining or better” in assessing the state law approaches that listed compliance options and
offered exceptions to white-lining being required in most or all cases. Site meetings creates more parity between the
excavator and locator, both ensuring improved communication and having them both on-site.
15 Iowa is graded green, but only because the exception is narrow enough.
16 White-lining in New Mexico is only required in incorporated areas.
17 Oregon is graded green, but only because the exception is narrow enough.
18 While this is the first year in our three-report series Aii has included white-lining for evaluation, it is a valuable
component of our report to track how frequently states update their dig laws and whether those changes foster
Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 8
States are graded green where they have white-lining practices that meet our definition and are
required by law. For a rating of green, white-lining must be the default action for excavators,
with limited or no exceptions. States with a ✦ meet this standard and succinctly and clearly
explain the requirement. (e.g. “Before notifying the appropriate regional notification center, an
excavator planning to conduct an excavation shall delineate the area to be excavated. If the area
is not delineated, an operator may, at the operator’s discretion, choose not to locate and field
mark until the area to be excavated has been delineated.”)19
Many state codes include a definition for white-lining, but the clause that actually employs the
definition may not require its use. States are graded yellow when white-lining is only required
when the excavation site cannot be clearly described or identified, or the exceptions swallow the
rule. Other states are graded yellow due to the requirement to delineate only upon the request of
the locator. Not all exceptions to white-lining result in a yellow grading, such as provisions that
allow exceptions based on practicality20 or when a more favorable alternative is selected, such as
unanimous agreement by all parties that marking is unneeded or the parties agree to a site visit.
States with codes that make no mention of Physical White-Lining at all receive a grade of red.
Four common deficiencies in white-lining requirements include:
1) Pre-marking is only required when the excavation site cannot be adequately or
“accurately” described on the locate request. (e.g. “When the excavation area cannot
be clearly and adequately identified within the area described in the notice, the excavator
shall designate the route, specific area to be excavated, or both by premarking the area
...”)21, 22 When “accurately” describing the site serves as an exception for white-lining, it
can weaken communication and lead to mistakes. Descriptions are subject to
interpretation, but visible markings are objective.
2) Pre-marking is only required upon request by the locator or facility operator. (e.g.
“On a timely request by the underground facilities operator, the excavator shall mark the
boundaries of the area requested to be excavated…”)23, 24
3) Pre-marking is at the discretion of the excavator. (e.g. “An excavator shall provide
adequate information to the owners of underground facilities in order to locate and mark
the location of underground facilities… The information may include but is not limited to
innovative solutions to promote the use of technology to improve communication and collaboration among
stakeholders to reduce the potential for excavation damage.

marking the path of the proposed excavation with white paint…”).25 While pre-marking
is indicated in the legislation, it is left as a voluntary practice.26
4) The exception threatens to swallow the rule. (e.g., “An excavator need not pre-mark as
required in this subsection if: (i) the underground facility owner… can determine the
location of the proposed excavation by street address or lot and block by referring to a
locate ticket…”)27, 28 In statutes where a street address or lot number is sufficient to serve
as an exception for white-lining, white-lining is no longer the default action, and does not
have to be used in the majority of excavations.
Because physical white-lining is an on-site task performed by the excavator by hand, there is no
facilitating role for the One-Call center.

Electronic White-Lining
Does the state provide the excavator the option to make a virtual or electronic pre-marking of
the excavation area?
We have defined electronic white-lining as excavators having the option, through the One-Call
center mobile application or website, to delineate the area of their proposed excavation site
virtually through an aerial view on an electronic map. To meet our criteria for electronic white-
lining, pre-marking must be required and the use of electronic or digital white-lining explicitly
encouraged or allowed. Electronic white-lining methods must be directly mentioned within the
law or regulations.
A basic web-entry locate request that uses a map but does not preserve the detailed input of the
excavator would not meet our definition of electronic white-lining. This would include One-Call
centers that allow excavators to draw a polygon, but when they submit, the system only retains a
buffered notification polygon (often of an entirely different shape).29
Only 10 states mention electronic white-lining options in their legislative or regulatory codes:
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois,30 Indiana,31 Iowa, Louisiana, North Dakota, Tennessee,
Virginia, Wyoming
In the last four years, four states have updated or amended the white-lining section of their dig
laws to include language relating to virtual or electronic white-lining.32
The Report Card does not grade each state on a scale (green, yellow or red) for providing the
option to utilize electronic white-lining. Instead, we note those states that do include it in their
definitions or requirements. While there are distinct benefits to electronic white-lining that
exceed certain benefits of physical white-lining, any kind of excavator pre-marking (physical or
electronic) is an important step in communication and collaboration between stakeholders.
Electronic white-lining has been shown to improve excavation outcomes and is recommended as
one of the opportunities with the greatest return-on-investment by the Next Practices Initiative

32 While this is the first year in our three-report series Aii has included electronic white-lining for evaluation, it is a

foster innovative solutions to promote the use of technology to improve communication and collaboration among
stakeholders to reduce the potential for excavation damage.
Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 11
from the Common Ground Alliance.33 Electronic white-lining increases accuracy of excavation-
site locations and can reduce over-notification to facility operators.
What One-Call center options exist to support or facilitate pre-marking?
Because electronic white-lining is a virtual task accomplished through a website or mobile
application of the One-Call center, there is an opportunity for the One-Call centers to voluntarily
offer excavators technological solutions beyond what the law requires. While One-Call programs
are not graded in this report, they may help facilitate permanent law changes that promote best
practices.
Electronic white-lining was jointly piloted in 2007 in the state of Virginia in coordination with
its One-Call center and PHMSA.34 A 2009 study provides cost comparisons and damage
outcomes demonstrating advantages of utilizing a virtual or electronic white-line in contrast to
not using this technology.35 According to an Aii survey in 2023, as many as 72 percent of One-
Call centers “offer an online mapping tool for excavators to pre-mark their digging site.”36
However, it is unclear to what extent such a mapping tool merely facilitates online ticket requests
to create general notification polygons or which truly function as electronic white-lining.37
Because approximately 72 percent of locate requests now come to U.S. One-Call centers as
electronic or web-entry requests (with only about 28 percent being phone calls or fax),38 there is
ample opportunity for One-Call centers to incorporate high-quality electronic white-lining as the
first step for the excavator making a locating request.
White-Line Conclusion:
Physical white-lining is a best practice that has been utilized for decades and was promoted in
the 1999 Common Ground Study by the U.S. Department of Transportation, while electronic
white-lining is a relatively newer process leveraging technology. In both cases, state laws have
been slow to uniformly require excavators to pre-mark their excavation site to improve
communication with the facility owner/operators and the locators.

For stakeholder understanding and compliance, simple and clear legal requirements are best.
While states rightly make reasonable exceptions, the law can and should create an unambiguous
requirement that applies in most or all cases. The default should be to pre-mark, with limited and
narrow exceptions.
A well written white-line law may look something like “Before every excavation, the excavator
shall employ physical white-lining, electronic white-lining, or both.” Practical exceptions may
include emergency excavations or “unless all parties agree in advance such marking is
unnecessary or agree to a site meeting.” Utilizing technology for white-lining is easier than ever
but should also come with robust guidelines to avoid confusion and mistakes.

Positive Response
In this section we review state law requirements around locators and/or facility owner/operators
providing information on the status and completeness of their work to excavators, either directly
or through the One-Call center. Positive Responses close the communication loop between
excavators, utility operators, and locators, both increasing participation and reducing confusion.
The three approaches to communication we review are: Positive Response, Electronic Positive
Response, and Enhanced Positive Response. While state law may require one or more of these
practices, electronic positive response and enhanced positive response are specifically
technology-based practices that One-Call centers can take the lead in developing and offering
irrespective of state laws.
Positive Response
Does the state require the communication loop between the excavator and locator to be closed?
We have defined a positive response as a requirement that the locator or facility operator, a)
notify the excavator directly or through the One-Call center that the location of the facilities at
the proposed excavation site has been marked, or (b) notify the excavator directly or through the
One-Call center that they do not have any facilities at the proposed excavation site.
To meet Aii’s criteria for positive response, a phone call, email, in-person communication, or
update to an online portal by the locator or operator is required. Marking the worksite alone (or
not marking a worksite where no facilities are present) would not meet this requirement.
Additionally, positive response must be mandated by law, not merely available through a One-
Call center program.
Positive response is important because it closes the communications loop between the excavator
and the locator. In its absence, an excavator could incorrectly assume that there were no facilities
in the work area if no markings are visible after the waiting period ends when, in fact, the site
had not been located within the required time period. This could be the result of a mistake,
weather, shortage of locators, or other scheduling issues. Unclear communication significantly
increases the possibility of an incident.
As seen in the Report Card, 27 states and Washington, D.C. have positive response requirements
that meet our definition:
Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska,
Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 14
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,39 South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, D.C.
Since our report in 2020, 14 states have updated or amended the positive response section of
their dig laws.40
States are graded green when they have positive response practices that meet our definition and
are required by law. States with a ✦ meet this standard and succinctly and clearly explain the
requirement. (e.g. “Each operator, upon determining that no underground facility is present on
the tract or parcel of land or upon completion of the marking of the location of any underground
facilities on the tract or parcel of land shall provide a positive response with information to the
‘One-Call Notification System.’”)41
States are graded yellow primarily on the basis of insufficient laws, which only require closing
the communication loop in some instances. States with codes that make no mention of Positive
Response at all receive a grade of red.
Four common deficiencies in positive response requirements are:
1) Spray paint or other markings are themselves deemed to be a positive response. (e.g.
“an operator…shall inform the excavator of the tolerance zone of the underground
facility…by marking, flagging or other acceptable method.”)42, 43
2) Notice is required only if no facilities are present. (e.g. “the operator shall: (i) mark the
location of its underground facilities… or (ii) notify the excavator…that the operator does
not have any underground facility in the area…”)44 While this is better than no
communication, it does not address the more critical issue of an unmarked site when
facilities are actually present. A positive response should require the locator or operator
to respond after marking or not marking to clarify that they did finish marking or why
they did not mark.45
3) Notice is required to the excavator only when the locator is unable to complete his
task, unable to find facilities, or otherwise leaves markings incomplete. (e.g. “If an
39 In practice, everyone treats Pennsylvania as having mandatory Positive Response. However, it is not clear from
the law that positive response is required. Further law changes would improve clarity.
40 The seven new additions that have joined this group in our report are Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Nevada New
Jersey, Oklahoma, and Washington D.C. However, three states also left this group due to the refined grading rubric.
The states that received green in 2020 but do not in 2024 are Alaska, Missouri, and Ohio.
41 Alabama Code §37-15-6(d).
42 Kansas Statute 66-1806(a).
43 States that fall under this deficiency include Arizona, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire. South Dakota, Utah, and Wisconsin.
44 Utah Code 54-8a-5(1)(a)(i)-(ii).
45 States with this deficiency include Arizona, Connecticut, Chicago, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.

underground facilities operator is unable to complete the location and marking within the
time period…the facility operator shall…provide prompt notice of these facts to the
excavator…”)46
4) The code provides for a positive response, even a clear and robust version, but it
only applies to certain facilities. (e.g. “Any operator who owns, operates, or both, an
underground facility used in the transportation of gas or hazardous liquids and subject to
the federal pipeline statute…”).47 State laws sometimes differentiate pipelines from other
underground facilities.48
Because basic positive response may utilize a direct phone call, email, or other communication,
this can be accomplished separately from the One-Call center or through the One-Call center.

48 Both New Hampshire and Texas have this deficiency. Part of the Indiana Code also differentiates pipeline
facilities, but 2024 law changes have solved this issue.
Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 16
Electronic Positive Response
Does the state require a technology-based platform all relevant parties can access and share the
status of a locate request?
For purposes of the Report Card, we have defined “Electronic Positive Response” as a
requirement that the One-Call center or other damage prevention authority form, host, or make
available a common-access platform where excavators, One-Call center personnel, utility
operators, and locators can all view and update the status of a locate ticket. To meet this
definition, an electronic positive response system, log-in smart phone application, or ticket status
check portal on the One-Call center website must be functional and its use required by law.
Leaving physical documents on site for the excavator would not meet our definition. Further,
online locate ticket entry without the ability to track or check the status of the ticket is
insufficient. Even if the worksite is properly marked and an effective positive response system is
in place, all of the parties – the excavator, the One-Call center, the operator, and the locator–
should be able to provide updates and track a locate request to view its progress at all times.
A common-access platform builds on positive response by allowing centralized, real-time
updates that can help reduce the likelihood of damage. With positive response,
miscommunication between locators and excavators can be reduced regarding the completion of
the locate. With electronic positive response, efficiency can be improved, and the
communication process can be further enhanced by allowing all parties to view and update
information on the ticket virtually in real time. Excavators do not need to check with individual
utility companies or wait for them to send a message, because excavators can check a single
portal to see the status of all locates as marked, cleared, or not yet marked. This can also reduce
confusion about whether all marks on site have been made when some locators have completed
their work, but others have not.
As noted above, while 27 states and Washington, D.C. require a positive response meeting our
definition, 22 require a technology-based platform for parties to post or view responses in real
time:
Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,49 Indiana,50
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Virginia51
49 Law goes into effect January 2026.
50 Law goes into effect January 2025.
51 Changes from 2020 include the additions of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,
Nevada, New Jersey, and North Dakota, while Missouri was removed due to deficiencies with its positive response
provision.
Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 17
Since our report in 2020, 11 states have updated or amended the positive response section of
their dig laws to include reference to electronic positive response.
The 22 states are graded green because they require by law an electronic online information
exchange system that allows all parties (the excavator, facility operator, locator, and One-Call
center) to track the progress of the locate request and record a positive response. Some states
receive a grade of green because the state law requires positive response to be submitted in
accordance with the One-Call center practice. States receive green ✦ for making the requirement
succinct and functional. (e.g. “[E]very operator shall supply an electronic positive response
through the regional notification center before the legal excavation start date and time.”)52
States graded yellow on the report card do not currently require that positive responses be shared
to a ticket check system and accessible to excavators through the One-Call center, or they
provide exceptions so that not require all operators or locators are required to provide digital
positive responses. This leaves excavators having to wait for phone calls, faxes, emails, or even
to rely on site markings. Virtually every state has at least a voluntary practice for ticket check
and electronic platforms, but grades are based on required compliance with laws and statutes. A
state may also be graded yellow if they include a provision for electronic positive response, but
the provision for positive response itself is deficient.
States with codes that make no mention of Electronic Positive Response at all receive a grade of
red.
Two common deficiencies in Electronic Positive Response requirements are:
1) Digital positive response is optional, but not required. (e.g. “The facility operator shall
promptly notify the center by facsimile, e-mail, telephone, or the one call center
computerized positive response system available on the worldwide web, of the action the
facility operator has taken.”)53
2) Lack of a mandatory centralized system to update and check locate requests (e.g.
“’Notice’ or ‘notify’ means contact in person or by telephone or other electronic
method… also results in the receipt of a valid excavation confirmation code.”)54
52 California Government Code § 4216.3 (c)(1)(A).

Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 18
What One-Call center options exist to support or facilitate information sharing through an
electronic positive response platform?
Because electronic positive response is a virtual task accomplished through a website or mobile
application of the One-Call center, there is an opportunity for the One-Call center to offer
excavators technological solutions to use voluntarily beyond what the law requires. While
voluntary One-Call programs are not graded in this report, they may help facilitate permanent
law changes that promote best practices.

Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 19
Enhanced Positive Response
Does the state require enhanced information to be shared between the facility owner, locator,
excavator, and One-Call center so that all can view the ticket, photos, maps, and/or other data?
We have defined “Enhanced Positive Response” as a requirement that the utility operator, One-
Call center, and locator make (1) the information that they have about the excavation site and the
underground facilities located there, and (2) information used or collected during the locate
process, available directly to the excavator through an electronic platform that we described
previously as Electronic Positive Response. To sufficiently meet our definition for Enhanced
Positive Response, the excavator must have access to locate request information, such as ticket
information, facility maps, digital photos taken by the locator, and virtual manifests. These have
been demonstrated to add value for all stakeholders, including excavators, locators, and facility
owners, improving safety, efficiency, and overall damage prevention.56 Additional enhanced
information beyond this is encouraged. Paper documents or printed photos left on site would not
meet this requirement unless they are also uploaded and accessible through the electronic
platform.
Even with a positive response system in place, inclement weather, construction, lawn mowing, or
other disruptions could wash away, shift, or otherwise remove markings that were properly made
when required. Allowing excavators to access additional information affords the excavator a
chance to double check, clarify, and dig with confidence. Additionally, facility maps or other
information that may be available from the facility owner, One-Call center, or locator may be
useful during excavation in avoiding damage.
There are several ways technology can be used to accomplish enhanced information sharing for
on-site quality control. Electronic positive response portals can at least allow, or at best require,
an attachment of the required additional information. Thus “marked” may be accompanied by an
additional column for hyperlinks or attachments including photos of the marked site, digital
maps, or other enhanced information.

not only status, but Comments, URL, and Attachments left by locators or operators.

As shown in the Report Card, only one state has updated its laws or regulations to require digital
transmission of information for better quality control at the work site:
Colorado
Since our report in 2020, no new states have updated their laws to include reference to
enhanced positive response.
The only state graded green is Colorado, which makes clear in its law that enhanced information
is required along with a positive response. In addition to markings, Colorado requires that facility
operators “shall provide for each of its underground facilities: (A) Documentation listing the
owner's or operator's name, the size and type of each marked underground facility. AND (B)
Documentation of the location of the underground facilities in the form of a digital sketch, a
hand-drawn sketch, or a photograph that includes a readily identifiable landmark, where
practicable.”57
In Washington, D.C. and Maryland, a voluntary EPR system is used by several companies. The
program is effective and should be explored and adopted as a minimum enforceable standard.
However, because it is a voluntary program not mentioned in state law, both Maryland and
Washington D.C. still receive scores of red.
Additional states have One-Call center practices encouraging but not requiring data sharing.
Utah offers facility owners the option to include image attachments and notes on positive
responses. While not required, and though falling short of robust EPR data sharing, it is an
encouraging step.
These are steps in the right direction. As legislators and regulators look at their sister states to
revise and improve on their rules, it is critical to maintain flexibility for operators and others to
experiment and improve rather than follow highly technical prescriptive rules.
States with codes that make no mention of Enhanced Positive Response at all receive a grade of
red.
The primary deficiency in Enhanced Positive Response, which limit on-site quality control,
are:
1) Voluntary or Pilot Program Enhanced Positive Response System. (e.g. A voluntary
EPR system is in use by several utility companies in Maryland and D.C., though the
program is not explicitly mentioned in any law or provision.)
57 Colorado Revised Statutes 9-1.5-104.2 (See also: https://newtin.co811.org/responsedisplay/).
Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 21
What One-Call center options exist to support or facilitate enhanced positive response for on-
site quality control?
Because enhanced positive response is a virtual task accomplished through a website or mobile
application of the One-Call center, there is an opportunity for the One-Call center to offer
excavators technological solutions to use voluntarily beyond what the law requires.
In Washington, D.C. and Maryland, EPR system is used by some companies.58 This facilitates
transmission of enhanced information. However, because this program is not mentioned in
Maryland law, that state is still graded ‘red’. We applaud the efforts of this voluntary practice,
which should be explored further and adopted as a minimum enforceable standard.
Positive Response Conclusion:
Positive response is a best practice that has been utilized for decades, while electronic positive
response and enhanced positive response are relatively newer and leverage the use of technology.
In each case, state laws have been slow to uniformly require the use of these effective
communication tools.
For stakeholder understanding and compliance, simple and clear legal requirements are best.
While states rightly make reasonable exceptions, the law can and should create an unambiguous
requirement that applies in most or all cases. The default should be to ensure that every locate
request – and every resulting utility notification – results in a positive response back to the
excavator (either directly or through the One-Call center). Improvements in the law can most
often be made to ensure a positive response is required for both completed markings and when
the utility operator indicates clear/no conflict with their infrastructure.
A well written positive response law may look something like “After every locate request, the
utility owner/operator shall provide a positive response through the One-Call center to provide
real-time status of the marking, including if the marking is completed and if no marking is
necessary, and providing all enhanced information relevant for the excavator to conduct on-site
quality control.” Practical exceptions may include exceptions for enhanced information provided
within a reasonable timeframe or to provide certain details upon request, such as facility maps.
Utilizing technology for positive response is easier than ever, and leveraging One-Call centers
and ticket check systems to achieve systemic adoption of electronic and enhanced positive
response is a natural opportunity for improved communication to reduced excavation damage.
58 In fact, the CGA best practice statement points to Washington, D.C. and Maryland as having EPR in daily use
stating in a reference: “EPR is in use as a daily process by Washington Gas, UtiliQuest and Miss Utility (OCCO 811
center for all locate requests in Washington DC and MD.” See, CGA Best Practice Guide Chapter 3. 3.31 Enhanced

Conclusion
Since our last Damage Prevention Report Card in 2020, 24 states and Washington, D.C. have
made changes to their excavation legislation or regulations. Of these, 16 states and Washington,
D.C. have revised the sections we evaluate here. While this is a positive step forward, fewer than
half of all states mandate white-lining, and there remains significant hesitation to formally adopt
technology-based damage prevention solutions. Many of the states that have revised their laws in
the past four years do not appear to have made any significant move to improve the systemic
adoption of technology to bolster the damage prevention process for stakeholder safety and
infrastructure protection.
We believe that most states continue to have inadequate excavation laws as they relate to damage
prevention. Efforts to incorporate best practices have been weakened by broad or unnecessary
exceptions and exemptions. Although forward-thinking voluntary measures from One-Call
centers are encouraging, the responsibility for driving lasting change ultimately rests with both
lawmakers and industry leaders.
Communication is the catalyst for increased safety and efficiency in excavation. Every new law
that enhances the exchange of information between excavators, locators, and utility operators
helps prevent costly accidents, injuries, and fatalities that occur each year. Many One-Call
centers already offer voluntary platforms to improve communication and collaboration among
stakeholders. Making these practices mandatory could save billions in annual excavation-related
damages. Specifically, incorporating well-accepted and proven consensus best practices into new
threshold requirements is called for. In line with industry and unanimous stakeholder agreement
to see innovative technological best practices as the new baseline standards for the ideal dig of
the future, state legislatures and policymakers should now act to meet the 2030 idealized dig and
see electronic white-lining and enhanced positive response as the first and second steps in every
dig.
Much work remains to be done, but industry leader and policymaker coordination is sure to
achieve great strides in the years ahead. With technology access no longer a barrier, due to the
proliferation of mobile devices, internet access, and robust One-Call center platforms offering
digital mapping and web-entry locate requests, there is no reason state laws should not embrace
basic yet innovative technological changes.
This report card is not intended to be used as a tool for criticizing state programs. Its purpose
instead is to shine a light on states that we perceive are moving in the right direction and to draw
attention to areas where states could improve their laws, regulations, and practices.

Methodology
In grading states for the Report Card, we consulted the legislative and regulatory code for all 50 states, Chicago, and Washington,
D.C. We also reviewed the available information from each One-Call Center website to identify voluntary and mandatory
practices for stakeholders.
We use the definitions described in the Report Card above for White-Lining, Electronic White-Lining, Positive Response,
Electronic Positive Response, and Enhanced Positive Response.
In applying these definitions, we looked to see if the state law, either through legislative or regulatory codes, clearly requires the
practice by most or all applicable stakeholders. If the law plainly requires the practice as the default procedure, the state receives
a score of green for both meeting our definition and being mandatory.
If the practice exists but is not required, has overbroad exceptions, or only applies to a minority of cases, the state receives a score
of yellow.
If the practice is not mentioned in state law in any meaningful or mandatory capacity, the state receives a score of red.
We have provided all relevant state law excerpts in the appendix for transparency in our grading, to invite stakeholders to review
our work and their state laws, and for policymakers and state legislators to access direct comparisons they may use to refine and
improve their state dig laws. This effort is undertaken to advance excavation safety, protect workers, improve infrastructure
reliability, limit economic harm, promote efficiency in infrastructure building, and encourage more innovative technology where
possible.
Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure | Aii.org 25
Appendix A: The Policy-Industry Approach
The damage prevention ecosystem functions within the boundaries of three key frameworks:
Law, Regulation, and Stakeholder Leadership.59 This Report Card takes into consideration each.
It means that our first review is the state legislative code – the dig laws – in all 50 states. We then
look for implementing regulation and regulatory codes (or non-legislative administrative law),
which 30 out of 50 states have. Regulations provide further details or requirements for how to
fulfill the dig laws. Finally, we discuss certain technological practices of each state’s One-Call
center.
Interestingly, some laws are written to require certain baseline standards, but the ball is
forwarded to the One-Call center’s court for implementation. For instance, in Alabama, a
positive response is required “in accordance with the procedures developed by the ‘One-Call
Notification System.’” This type of provision means the One-Call centers can take the lead in
setting the standard. They could require as basic of information as submit “completed/marked”
or “clear/no conflict” along with a two-digit code, or as advanced as requiring that the positive
response be submitted to a virtual platform that is accessible by the excavator and includes
hyperlinks and attachments for things like the ticket, digital photographs, virtual facility maps,
and manifests (comprising an enhanced positive response). This unique style of legislation
highlights the interplay between public policy and industry leadership.
Appendix B: State Law and Regulatory Excerpts
The excerpts below include relevant legal language to address both physical and electronic
white-lining as well as positive response, electronic positive response, and enhanced positive
response in all 50 states, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Bolded text is emphasized by us to
highlight certain provisions. In many cases, these point to exceptions that result in a grade of
yellow. Bolding is intended as a helpful guide for reading the excerpts but may not capture every
relevant word or clause. Additionally, the formatting of each legal text is not always preserved in
order to save space, but sections and subsections are retained to provide accurate reference
material.
59 To be sure, many other structures exist to include contracts, company policies, and market incentives, but these
are binding on particular parties and in different ways than broadly applicable state and federal law. This report
examines state laws in particular. Stakeholder Leadership here mainly refers to the One-Call centers, a key
stakeholder that facilitates much of the process – whereas any given stakeholder leading may not exert binding rules
on individual parties, the One-Call center does interact with virtually all parties and the policies and procedures they
make act as “rule” stakeholders must follow to effectively participate in the 811 program and damage prevention
process.
