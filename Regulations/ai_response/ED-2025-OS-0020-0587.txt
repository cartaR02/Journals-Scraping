**Advocate Calls for Enhanced Social-Emotional Learning in Schools**

In a heartfelt letter directed to the U.S. Department of Education, a concerned mother has urged national officials to prioritize social-emotional learning (SEL) across both private and public educational settings. With firsthand experience in both types of institutions as a mother of four and educator, she has emphasized the necessity of supporting children who struggle socially and emotionally.

The letter writer stated, “A child who has not been able to flourish socially and emotionally will only struggle more academically. We need to support these students in any and all settings, more than we currently do.” She highlighted her experiences as a substitute teacher in a private K-12 school and as an interventionist for reading and math in a public elementary school, noting the profound impact that SEL can have on students' futures.

Drawing from her background, she expressed that many students in her public school environment have fallen behind due to social and emotional issues, remarking, “All studies prove that by focusing resources on the early grades (K-3), we reduce challenges later.” Her appeal for early intervention resonates with current educational research that underscores the importance of addressing these foundational aspects of learning.

In a bold critique, the writer condemned the growing emphasis on faith-based institutions and voucher systems, labeling it “morally reprehensible.” She articulated her belief that education should expand one’s perspective rather than restrict it to a single belief system. “How can an individual freely choose anything if they are systematically programmed by dogma?” she asked, asserting that true education involves exposure to diverse ideas and experiences.

The mother concluded her letter with a passionate plea for broader educational horizons, stating, “Let us not limit what young people can learn by our own small-mindedness.” Her stance reflects a growing sentiment among educators and parents advocating for a more holistic approach to education that nurtures emotional and social well-being alongside traditional academics.

The letter was sent to the U.S. Department of Education on October 1, 2023. No specific recipients of the letter were identified.


----------------INPUT:----------------

 As the mother of four young adults who were educated in both private and public schools, I have
experience in different aspects of education.
I have worked as a substitute in a private K-12 school and an interventionist for Reading and Math in a
public elementary school.
I would like to see SEL enhanced in every setting. A child who has not been able to flourish socially, and
emotionally will only struggle more academically. We need to support these students in any and all
settings, more than we currently do.
Many of the students I worked with in the public school setting had fallen behind for social and
emotional reasons. All studies prove that by focusing resources on the early grades (K-3) we reduce
challenges later.
I also find the emphasis on faith-based institutions and vouchers morally reprehensible. An education
should broaden one’s mind, not program it to believe one and only one belief system.
How can an individual freely choose anything if they are systematically programed by dogma? Education
is as much about exposure as it is about application to one’s life.
Let us not limit what young people can learn by our own small mindedness.
