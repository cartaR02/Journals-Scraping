**Federal Employee Voices Concerns Over Proposed Rule Changes Affecting Civil Service**

A federal employee has submitted a letter to the Office of Personnel Management expressing serious concerns over the proposed rule "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." The letter, authored by an unnamed employee who currently works in a federal executive agency, argues that the proposed changes would undermine the integrity and effectiveness of the civil service.

In the letter, the employee writes, "If my position is moved into the new Schedule Policy/Career, and I can be fired simply because I provide unbiased advice about the potential consequences of different policy choices, that will have a chilling effect on the advice that I provide to the actual policy decision makers." The letter emphasizes that this shift could lead to a significant decrease in the quality of advice provided to political appointees, ultimately harming taxpayer interests and the integrity of rulemaking efforts.

The author strongly opposes the proposed rule and urges the Office of Personnel Management to retain existing regulations that protect civil service employees. They note, "The changes to OPMâ€™s regulations proposed in the 2025 NPRM, if finalized, would degrade the quality of the civil service and make it more difficult to recruit and retain qualified employees who wish to serve the public and defend the U.S. Constitution."

Furthermore, the letter highlights concerns regarding merit system principles, stating, "The 2025 NPRM should be withdrawn in its entirety because it does not align with the totality of the Merit System Principles." The employee argues that the proposed changes focus too heavily on the authority of the President, potentially infringing upon the legislative powers of Congress.

The letter contends that the proposed rule lacks sufficient evidence to justify the need for such sweeping changes and suggests that the creation of the new Schedule Policy/Career could lead to greater corruption within federal agencies and weaken the foundation of unbiased public service.

The letter was submitted via the Federal eRulemaking Portal on April 23, 2025. While the author remains anonymous, it reflects the concerns of many who believe that the proposed regulations threaten the core values of the civil service system.
