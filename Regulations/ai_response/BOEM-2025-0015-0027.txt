**Broward County Mayor Rejects Offshore Drilling in Letter to Federal Agency**

Broward County Mayor Beam Furr declared strong opposition to new offshore oil and gas leasing along Florida's coast in a letter sent to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The letter addressed the agency's ongoing request for information regarding offshore drilling and the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

"The potential short-term benefits to energy companies do not outweigh the long-term threats to coastal livelihoods, local industries, and our natural resources," Furr stated. He emphasized that the county's economy is deeply reliant on clean beaches, healthy ecosystems, and a thriving tourism sector, generating over $700 million annually.

Asserting the risks associated with offshore drilling, Furr remarked that even the perception of potential oil and gas activity could deter tourism and undermine property values. "A major spill would have long-lasting consequences for small businesses, fisheries, and the thousands of jobs that rely on a healthy coastal environment," he warned.

Furr urged the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to take economic concerns into account while prioritizing coastal protection in the upcoming leasing program. "I look forward to working with our elected officials in Congress to support policies that safeguard our shorelines and reject any efforts to expand offshore oil and gas development," he added.

The letter was co-signed by several members of the Broward County Board of County Commissioners: Nan Rich, Mark Bogen, Michael Udine, Lamar Fisher, Steve Geller, Beam Furr, Alexandra Davis, Robert McKinzie, and Hazelle Rogers. Their collective stance highlights a united front in opposing offshore drilling, reinforcing their commitment to safeguard both the environment and local economies.

The letter expressing these concerns was sent to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management [BOEM] on a recent date, aiming to influence the upcoming program for potential energy leasing. The effort underlines the importance of community voices in environmental and economic discussions surrounding offshore drilling.

RE: BOEM’s request for information regarding Offshore Drilling and the National Outer Continental Shelf
Oil and Gas Leasing Program
To Whom It May Concern,
As Mayor of Broward County, I am writing to express our firm opposition to the inclusion of new offshore oil and
gas leasing off the coast of Florida in the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.
Coastal economies like ours are built on the foundation of clean beaches, healthy ecosystems, and vibrant tourism
and marine industries. Broward County’s economy generates over $700 million from our beaches each year. In
addition, our award-winning beaches are internationally-recognized for their high quality, clean experiences for
families of all backgrounds.
Offshore drilling puts all of that at risk. Even the perception of risk from oil and gas activity can negatively affect
tourism, property values, and investor confidence. A major spill would have long-lasting consequences for small
businesses, fisheries, and the thousands of jobs that rely on a healthy coastal environment.
I believe it is not in the best interest of our community, or our economy, to open our coasts to offshore drilling. The
potential short-term benefits to energy companies do not outweigh the long-term threats to coastal livelihoods, local
industries, and our natural resources.
I urge the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to take these economic concerns seriously and to prioritize the
protection of our coasts in the upcoming leasing program. I look forward to working with our elected officials in
Congress to support policies that safeguard our shorelines and reject any efforts to expand offshore oil and gas
development.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments. I appreciate your consideration of the interests of coastal
businesses and communities like ours.
Thank you,
Broward County Board of County Commissioners
