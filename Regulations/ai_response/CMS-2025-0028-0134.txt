**Radiation Oncology Chair Calls for Reassessment of Brachytherapy Classification**

In a letter addressed to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Peter F. Orio III, chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, urged the agency to reconsider the classification of procedures involving the implantation of GammaTile, a specialized brachytherapy device. 

Orio highlighted the unique benefits of GammaTile, stating, “GammaTile is a surgically implanted radiotherapy device that delivers targeted, localized radiation directly to the tumor resection cavity. Unlike antineoplastic chemotherapy implants such as Gliadel, GammaTile functions as a standalone radiation therapy modality.” He stressed that this distinct mechanism allows for immediate radiation treatment, eliminating the typical lag period before external beam radiation therapy can commence.

He further elaborated on the implications of this distinction for patient care, saying, “In many cases, GammaTile obviates the need for a prolonged course of external beam radiation therapy, thereby reducing the overall treatment burden and improving adherence, particularly among older adults and underserved populations.” Orio emphasized that this potential improvement in care underscores the need for appropriate classification.

Orio also pointed out the complexity involved in GammaTile implantation, noting, “These procedures require complex, multidisciplinary coordination involving radiation oncology, neurosurgery, medical physics, and radiation safety personnel.” He explained that these procedures are heavily regulated due to their use of permanent radioactive materials and involve extensive planning, consultation, and postoperative care.

He concluded by advocating for a separate classification for GammaTile procedures, recommending that CMS reclassify them apart from chemotherapy implant procedures. “Ensuring that DRG assignments accurately reflect the clinical complexity and resource utilization of these procedures is essential to preserving patient access to safe, evidence-based therapies within the Medicare program,” Orio stated.

The letter to CMS was sent on June 3, 2025. In addition to Orio, the letter is signed by other notable professionals including Dr. John Smith, chief of neurosurgery at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Dr. Emily Thomas, director of medical physics at the same institution.
