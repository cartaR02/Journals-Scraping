**EPA Urged to Strengthen Incinerator Regulations Amid Environmental Concerns**

In a recent letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Mike Ewall, executive director of the Energy Justice Network, has expressed serious concerns about the agency's current draft regulations for new and existing trash incinerators. His communication highlights significant inadequacies that could result in elevated emissions from proposed facilities, including a large incinerator in Miami-Dade County.

"When the Trump family comes out opposed to building a new trash incinerator near their resort in Doral, you know that the new regulations must be insufficient," Ewall stated, referencing public sentiment against the planned 4,000 ton/day trash incinerator in Florida, which would become the largest facility of its kind in the Americas.

Ewall criticized the recent decisions made by Miami-Dade officials, who contended that an incinerator in Palm Beach County is the "cleanest and greenest" in the nation. He provided reports indicating that any new incinerator, even if it meets proposed regulations, would likely rank among the largest industrial air polluters in the respective counties.

"The draft regulations for new municipal waste combustors are woefully inadequate if they still permit the kind of pollution that major industrial sources produce," Ewall asserted. He emphasized the need for continuous emissions monitoring and better performance standards, citing studies that show existing methods underestimate the actual emissions of harmful pollutants like dioxins.

Moreover, Ewall urged the EPA to improve standards for existing incinerators, especially concerning pollutant limits that could lead to insignificant reductions in emissions. He highlighted incidents where dioxin emissions were grossly underestimated, calling for stringent actions in monitoring practices.

Among the several loopholes he identified, Ewall pointed to regulations that allow for dioxin testing on just one burner annually as highly inappropriate. "This means that each burner is tested once every four years for the most toxic chemicals," he commented, advocating for annual testing on every burner.

Ewall concluded his comprehensive letter by emphasizing the need to include data from continuous monitoring in air quality reporting, particularly concerning the emerging threat of PFAS emissions linked to incineration processes.

The letter was sent to the EPA on May 30, 2025, with the recipient being Administrator Zeldin. Ewall was the sole signatory on this decisive communication.

Dear Administrator Zeldin:
When the Trump family comes out opposed to building a new trash incinerator near their resort in Doral,
you know that the new regulations must be insufficient. In the past year, Miami-Dade County was
considering building a 4,000 ton/day trash incinerator (large municipal waste combustor). In fact, it
would be the largest in the Americas. The following are links to a few of many news articles on the topic:
https://www.wastedive.com/news/florida-wte-miami-dade-delay-lee-palm-beach-county/734561/
https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/eric-trump-urges-miami-dade-county-to-not-build-new-
incinerator-in-doral-commissioner-says/3482079/
https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/report-eric-trump-joins-opposition-to-proposed-doral-
incinerator/
Miami-Dade County has pointed to the newest trash incinerator in the nation -- Palm Beach County's
3,000 ton/day "Renewable Energy Facility 2" (REF2) facility in West Palm Beach, Florida -- calling it the
"cleanest and greenest" in the nation.
Attached are two reports showing that if a new incinerator were built at the 3,000 or 4,000 ton/day
capacities considered by Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties (home to Trump's Doral resort and to
Mar-a-Lago, respectively), they would be among the largest industrial air polluters in each of those
counties. This is assuming that a new incinerator is as "clean and green" as the ten-year-old REF2
incinerator, but even cleaner on two pollutants, as required to meet the draft LMWC regulations. To meet
these new regulations, only two pollutants, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, would have to be further
reduced -- by about 40% each -- to fall safely within the draft regulations for new LWMC facilities.
The draft regulations for NEW LWMCs are woefully inadequate if meeting them would still allow a facility
to be as polluting as the other major industrial sources on these two South Florida counties.
Even more inadequate are the draft regulations for existing LWMCs. On March 21, 2023, EPA presented
three options for how strict the new regulations might be for nine pollutants. The draft rule ultimately
chose the weakest of the three options for eight of the nine pollutants, and the middle option for nitrogen
oxides.

This is unacceptable, as it leaves too many communities heavily polluted with insignificant reductions in
emissions from existing incinerators. The more protective standards should be adopted, if not actually
requiring existing incinerators to come up to the standards for new incinerators.
There is also a dire need for continuous emissions monitoring (or continuous sampling where genuine
continuous monitoring is not commercially available), and for performance standards and emissions
limits based on what is found with this monitoring. As we have documented from data reported by the
Reworld (Covanta) Delaware Valley incinerator in the City of Chester, Pennsylvania, continuous
emissions monitoring of hydrochloric acid emissions shows that actual emissions are 62% higher than
their annual stack tests indicate. EPA ought to obtain the data from other incinerators that continuously
monitor for HCl to reproduce and verify the level of discrepancy between continuous monitoring and
annual stack tests. All six trash incinerators in Pennsylvania, plus a few others use continuous
monitoring for HCl. Where there are examples of incinerators continuously monitoring other pollutants
(some have done this for mercury, ammonia and particulate matter), these should also be compared for
discrepancies, in recognition that annual stack tests are less reliable because they do not capture
emissions at startup, shutdown, and malfunction times.
Even more stark is the situation with dioxins. One study out of Europe documented that using continuous
sampling for dioxins at incinerators revealed the actual emissions to be 32-52 times higher than we think
they are in the U.S. when requiring incinerators to test each unit just once every one to four years under
ideal operating conditions.[1] A more recent study found that failure to use continuous sampling
technology is underestimating dioxin emissions by 460 to 1,290 times.[2]
All regulated pollutants are able to be continuously monitored or continuously sampled. Continuous
monitoring must be required for all regulated pollutants, with continuous sampling allowed for those
where continuous monitors are not yet commercially available.
As EPA starts to make trash incinerators report to the Toxics Release Inventory, the continuous
monitoring/sampling data ought to be used to provide the most accurate reporting on air emissions. See
EPA's 12/20/2024 response to rulemaking petition PET-001757 here:
https://energyjustice.net/incineration/EPA-TRI-PetitionResponse.pdf
PFAS emissions are an emerging concern, and there is a growing body of scientific data showing that
incineration does not fully destroy PFAS, but converts some of it to short-chain PFAS compounds that
are emitted into the air, while much of the rest becomes hydrofluoric acid emissions. PFAS and HF
emissions should also be regulated and monitored with continuous monitoring (HF) and sampling (PFAS
and related compounds).
We urge you to close a few other loopholes in incinerator regulations as well:
First, the regulations allowing incinerators to test dioxins/furans for just one burner each year is highly
inappropriate considering how irregular dioxin emissions can be, and how they are the most toxic class
of chemicals known to science. At an incinerator with as many as four burners, this means that each
burner is tested once every four years for the most toxic chemicals they release. The regulations should
require continuous sampling for dioxins/furans, but at a minimum, they at least should have to test every
burner annually.
Secondly, there are three pollutants (mercury, sulfur dioxide, and hydrochloric acid) for which the federal
2
regulations provide two ways to comply: a concentration based limit as well as a percentage reduction.
The percentage reduction loophole allows facilities to exceed their concentration-based limit if they
happen to burn a large quantity of mercury-, sulfur- or chlorine-containing wastes. This should not be
permitted.
Finally, the loophole for burning of unprocessed medical waste in trash incinerators must be closed. This
loophole, at 40 CFR ï¿½ 60.50c(e), allows trash incinerators to start burning any percentage of medical
waste and still only be bound by the weaker municipal waste combustor regulations rather than the
medical waste incinerator regulations. The differences are substantial, as shown on page 7 of the
attached FAQ on medical waste burning in Connecticut (which was recently permitted to take place at
the LWMC in Bristol, CT).
Please include the attached reports as part of my comments to be reviewed.
