This is the final air construction permit, which authorizes the construction of a new municipal waste combustor
unit. The proposed work will be conducted at the existing Pasco County Resource Recovery Facility, which is a
municipal waste combustor plant categorized under Standard Industrial Classification No. 4953. The existing
facility is located in Pasco County at 14230 Hays Road in Spring Hill, Florida. The UTM coordinates are Zone
17, 347.11 kilometers (km) East, and 3,139.21 km North.
This final permit is organized into the following sections: Section 1 (General Information); Section 2
(Administrative Requirements); Section 3 (Emissions Unit Specific Conditions); and Section 4 (Appendices).
Because of the technical nature of the project, the permit contains numerous acronyms and abbreviations, which
are defined in Appendix A of Section 4 of this permit. As noted in the Final Determination provided with this
final permit, only minor changes and clarifications were made to the draft permit.

SECTION 1. GENERAL INFORMATION
FACILITY DESCRIPTION
The Pasco County Resource Recovery Facility (PCRRF) began operation in May 1991. The three existing
municipal waste combustor (MWC) units at the facility can process a nominal design rated capacity of 1,050 tons
per day (TPD) of solid waste having an average higher heating value (HHV) of 5,000 British thermal units per
pound (Btu/lb), generating up to 31.2 megawatts (MW). The facility is owned by Pasco County and operated by
Covanta Pasco, Inc. The three existing MWC units produce power by sending steam to a single steam turbine
generator with a 3-cell, wet cooling tower. The facility includes two landfills that are permitted to accept ash and
municipal solid waste. The facility typically accepts delivery of waste six days a week and processes the waste 24
hours per day, seven days a week. The facility also operates an ash building and handling system that manages
the ash generated from the existing MWC units. The facility has an existing storage silo for storage of activated
carbon used for emissions control from the existing MWC units.
PROPOSED PROJECT
Pasco County submitted an application for an air construction permit subject to the preconstruction review
requirements of the PSD of Air Quality pursuant to Rule 62-212.400, F.A.C. Pasco County is proposing to
construct one additional MWC unit (Unit No. 4) at the PCRRF. The project will involve the construction of
additional ancillary units for Unit No. 4, including a new activated carbon storage silo, hydrated lime storage silo,
and a 2-cell expansion of the PCRRF’s existing wet cooling tower. The project will also involve the installation
of Covanta’s low nitrogen oxide (NO ) technology (LNTM) on MWC Unit Nos. 1 – 3 in order to meet a new
X
federally enforceable NO emission limit for those units.

This section of the permit addresses the following emissions unit.
EU No. Emission Unit Description
015 Municipal Waste Combustor Unit #4
This emissions unit will be the fourth municipal waste combustor unit (MWC) (Unit No. 4) installed at the
PCRFF. The unit will have its own dedicated steam electrical turbine generator rated at 18 megawatts (MW,
nominal). The nominal design capacity of Unit No. 4 will be 475 tons per day of municipal solid waste (MSW),
based on the following nominal design characteristics: heat input capacity of 205.8 million British thermal units
per hour (MMBtu/hour); steam output of 140,000 lb/hour; and MSW heating value of 5,200 Btu/lb. All of these
capacities are descriptive and may change based on the characteristics of the MSW charged to the unit.
Unit No. 4 will be integrated into the existing PCRFF, including use of the fourth flue in the existing facility air
pollution stack. Emissions of NO will be controlled by Covanta’s LNTM technology and a selective non-catalytic
X
reactor system. Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO ), sulfuric acid mist (SAM), hydrochloric acid (HCl), other acid
2
gases, mercury, and dioxins/furans (D/F) will be controlled by a circulating dry scrubber system, which includes
hydrated lime injection and powdered activated carbon (PAC) injection, in conjunction with a fabric filter system
(baghouse). Emissions of particulate matter (PM/PM /PM ) and MWC metals (cadmium, lead, mercury) will

be controlled by the fabric filter system (baghouse). Emissions of CO and volatile organic compounds (VOC)
will be minimized by good combustion practices, including proper operation and maintenance of the unit.
Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) will be minimized by implementation of efficient design and proper
operation and maintenance of the unit (combustion improvements).
{Permitting Note: In accordance with Rule 62-212.400(PSD), F.A.C., the above emissions unit is subject to Best
Available Control Technology (BACT) determinations for the following pollutants: SO , MWC Acid Gases (as

malfunction, monitoring data shall be dismissed or excluded from compliance calculations but shall be
recorded and reported in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 60.59b(d)(7).
b. For NSPS limits only, the startup period commences when the affected facility begins the continuous
burning of municipal solid waste and does not include any warmup period when the affected facility is
combusting fossil fuel or other nonmunicipal solid waste fuel, and no municipal solid waste is being fed
to the combustor. Continuous burning is the continuous, semicontinuous, or batch feeding of municipal
solid waste for purposes of waste disposal, energy production, or providing heat to the combustion system
in preparation for waste disposal or energy production. The use of municipal solid waste solely to
provide thermal protection of the grate or hearth during the startup period when municipal solid waste is
not being fed to the grate is not considered to be continuous burning.
c. For the purposes of compliance with the CO emission limit in paragraph b of Specific Condition 14, if a
loss of boiler water level control or a loss of combustion air control is determined to be a malfunction, the
duration of the malfunction period is limited to 15 hours per occurrence. During such periods of
malfunction, monitoring data shall be dismissed or excluded from compliance calculations but shall be
recorded and reported in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 60.59b(d)(7). During a loss of boiler
water level control or a loss of combustion air control malfunction period, a diluent cap of 14% oxygen or
5% carbon dioxide may be used in the emission calculations for SO and NO .
