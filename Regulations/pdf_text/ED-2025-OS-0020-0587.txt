As the mother of four young adults who were educated in both private and public schools, I have
experience in different aspects of education.
I have worked as a substitute in a private K-12 school and an interventionist for Reading and Math in a
public elementary school.
I would like to see SEL enhanced in every setting. A child who has not been able to flourish socially, and
emotionally will only struggle more academically. We need to support these students in any and all
settings, more than we currently do.
Many of the students I worked with in the public school setting had fallen behind for social and
emotional reasons. All studies prove that by focusing resources on the early grades (K-3) we reduce
challenges later.
I also find the emphasis on faith-based institutions and vouchers morally reprehensible. An education
should broaden one’s mind, not program it to believe one and only one belief system.
How can an individual freely choose anything if they are systematically programed by dogma? Education
is as much about exposure as it is about application to one’s life.
Let us not limit what young people can learn by our own small mindedness.
