The proposed regulation would result in the reclassification of NIH Institute Directors,
Center Directors and Institute Division Directors as political appointees. This will
negatively impact the scientific integrity of the federal grant award process. Is the goal
here to destroy the most successful biomedical research program in the world? It would
seem so. This resolution will severely derail the development of treatments for diseases
that affect the health of many Americans. It should not be considered. NIH has not
been “weaponized” as some members of the current administration seem to think. It
has served the American people well for many years and many of us have benefited
from the work performed and/or funded by the NIH.
