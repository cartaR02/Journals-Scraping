Defend Federal Agencies And Employees In Natural Resource Conservation
WHEREAS, the Conservation Federation of Missouri (CFM) represents 105 affiliate
organizations and 68,711 members across the state, collectively advocating for the interests of
hunters, anglers, outdoor recreationists, conservation professionals, farmers, private landowners,
and others who depend on and enjoy sound natural resource management and federal
environmental protections; and
WHEREAS, federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management
(BLM), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS), Farm Services Agency (FSA), and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), among others, play a critical role in the conservation of
our nation’s air, water, land, and wildlife resources providing critical benefits to local and state
economies; and
WHEREAS, these agencies are foundational to the stewardship of our nation’s natural resources
held for the public trust, food security, disaster preparedness, and outdoor recreation of all types;
and
WHEREAS, these agencies employ people who have assumed a critical and often
underappreciated role as public servants working as natural resource professionals, park rangers,
support staff, land managers, scientists, researchers, and more in programs that are underfunded
and understaffed; and
WHEREAS, these public servants have committed themselves to providing expertise that
informs sound policy decisions and environmental protections as well as support and service to
all Americans whether they be urban, suburban, or rural; and
WHEREAS, ongoing adverse administrative actions, budget cuts, and legislative proposals
diminish the ability of these agencies to fulfill their missions, resulting in the reduction or loss of
vital expertise, environmental protections, scientific integrity, and critical public services; and
WHEREAS, recent and ongoing administrative actions and budget cuts have resulted in the
firing of early-career natural resource professionals and scientists, as well as staffing reductions
affecting mid- and late-career professionals, threatening the loss of an entire generation of
expertise; and
WHEREAS, these professionals, many at their most vulnerable career stage after investing four
to ten years in education, often lack financial stability and may be forced to leave the field
altogether, permanently altering the trajectory of conservation science and management; and
WHEREAS, natural resource agencies contribute significantly to state and local economies by
employing contractors, supporting local businesses and non-profit organizations through
conservation projects, and generating tourism and outdoor recreation revenue, while their
degradation negatively impacts economic stability by reducing investment in conservation
programs, weakening disaster preparedness, and threatening the viability of outdoor recreation
and agriculture, which are vital to Missouri’s economy; and
WHEREAS, resilience to climate change, habitat degradation, and biodiversity loss depends on
strong federal agencies, robust scientific research, and the enforcement of existing environmental
laws; and
WHEREAS, state agencies such as the Missouri Departments of Conservation, Natural
Resources, and Agriculture—as well as private citizens, businesses, universities, non-profit
organizations, and other stakeholders—rely on federal data, research, and partnerships to inform
resource planning, conservation initiatives, land management decisions, and economic policies;
and
WHEREAS, federal agencies and funding federal programs is essential to ensure the long-term
sustainability of Missouri’s wildlife, fisheries, forests, grasslands, wetlands, agriculture, soil,
rivers, and streams; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED, that the Conservation Federation of Missouri, assembled this 8th day of March,
2025, in Lake Ozark, Missouri, strongly supports the federal employees, their families, and the
dedicated farmers, ranchers, and landowners who rely on these programs to steward our natural
resources, sustain agricultural productivity, support economic development, and protect the lands
and waters that benefit all Americans; and be it further
RESOLVED, that CFM condemns the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency
(DOGE) and other efforts - whether through administrative actions, legislative initiatives, or
agency restructuring - that weaken or eliminate federal conservation agencies, reduce scientific
funding, undermine the viability of our country’s agricultural and natural resources, or hinder
data accessibility; and be it further
RESOLVED, that CFM urges Missouri’s Congressional delegation and federal agencies, with
the support of Missouri’s governor, to immediately restore and fully support these agencies
through adequate funding, policy protections, and recognition of their vital and critical role in
natural resources stewardship, economic resilience, and state and national well-being; and be it
finally
RESOLVED, that those who have been terminated from their positions due to budget cuts and
administrative actions must be reinstated so that their expertise, dedication, and service to the
American public can continue to benefit our natural resources, agricultural communities, and
public lands.
