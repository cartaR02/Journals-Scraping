Hi, my name is Jessilyn Reyes and I am a student at the University of California, Santa
Barbara. I am writing to you to share my thoughts on the 1th National Outer Continental
Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. I have some concerns regarding the expansion
of offshore drilling, especially along our California coast. Through my environmental studies
class, I learned that this area is home to a diverse range of marine species and ecosystems.
Adding more oil and gas activity to their habitats does not seem ethical when there is such a
high risk of oil spillage and other environmental damages. Also, with the rise of more efficient
clean energy and the current climate crisis, it feels backwards and outdated to be investing
in fossil fuels when there are more sustainable alternatives. I hope BOEM takes Californiaâ€™s
aspirations of moving away from oil and protecting our coast seriously, and we keep the
Pacific OCS out of this leasing plan. We should really be thinking about the future of our
planet, and that entails clean energy, not drilling.
