To Whom It May Concern:
As Chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and a physician
specializing in brachytherapy for the treatment of malignant tumors, I respectfully urge CMS to
reconsider the current MS-DRG assignment for procedures involving the implantation of radioactive
brachytherapy devices, specifically GammaTile.
GammaTile is a surgically implanted radiotherapy device that delivers targeted, localized radiation
directly to the tumor resection cavity. Unlike antineoplastic chemotherapy implants such as Gliadel
(carmustine), GammaTile functions as a standalone radiation therapy modality. It initiates radiation
treatment immediately following tumor resection—eliminating the customary four- to six-week delay
required before initiating external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). This is a clinically meaningful
distinction. In many cases, GammaTile obviates the need for a prolonged course of EBRT, thereby
reducing the overall treatment burden and improving adherence, particularly among older adults and
underserved populations. In contrast, chemotherapy implants such as Gliadel do not replace systemic
chemotherapy and do not eliminate the need for EBRT.
The implantation of radioactive brachytherapy devices like GammaTile also presents a significantly
different clinical and operational profile compared to chemotherapy-based implants. These
procedures require complex, multidisciplinary coordination involving radiation oncology,
neurosurgery, medical physics, and radiation safety personnel. They are subject to strict federal and
state regulations governing the use of permanent radioactive implants. From the perspective of a
radiation oncologist, inpatient brachytherapy procedures demand considerable planning and
oversight, including preoperative mapping, intraoperative consultation, and time-intensive
postoperative dosimetry. These requirements—and the associated clinical resources and regulatory
burdens—greatly exceed those associated with chemotherapy wafer implantation, which is
comparatively straightforward.
In light of these substantial differences in therapeutic intent, regulatory oversight, and resource
intensity, I recommend that CMS reclassify GammaTile implantation procedures (reported with ICD-
10-PCS code 00H004Z) separately from other antineoplastic chemotherapy implant procedures, such
as Gliadel.
Ensuring that DRG assignments accurately reflect the clinical complexity and resource utilization of
these procedures is essential to preserving patient access to safe, evidence-based therapies within the
Medicare program.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if additional
information would be helpful.
Sincerely,
