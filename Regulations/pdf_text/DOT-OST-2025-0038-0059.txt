To Whom it May Concern,
I am writing in strong support of Gian-Carlo Peressutti's candidacy for appointment to the U.S.
Department of Transportation Advisory Board.
In my current capacity as Executive Director of the Global Infrastructure Investor Association
- the membership body for the world's leading investors in infrastructure, and advisors to the
sector, who collectively represent US $2.04 trillion of infrastructure assets under management
across 68 countries - I have worked closely with Gian-Carlo on a myriad issues involving
finance and infrastructure and feel he would lend an important voice to the work of this board.
Gian-Carlo is well-versed in the U.S. public policy landscape as well as the investment
challenges that private capital faces in infrastructure, most especially involving transportation
assets. His time in the public sector as well as in private finance will provide a unique
perspective to the work of the board and to ensuring that America's transportation
infrastructure is poised to evolve and improve to world-class excellence.
Many thanks for your consideration and please do not hesitate to contact me as necessary.
Sincerely yours,
J~ f~
