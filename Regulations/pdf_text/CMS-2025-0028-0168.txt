Re: CMS-1833-P Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the
Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Policy Changes and Fiscal Year 2026 Rates; Requirements for
Quality Programs; and Other Policy Changes
Dear Administrator Oz:
I am writing this letter as an academic psychiatrist at the Medical University of South Carolina that has been involved
with brain stimulation for over 20 years and with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) since 2006 before it was FDA
approved. I continue to perform research, clinical care, and education about TMS. I have been involved with many
patients receiving TMS with excellent outcomes but faster more effective treatments for major depression in an acute
inpatient setting are needed.
I am commenting on CMS’ Proposed FY 2026 Inpatient Prospective Payment System and the New Technology Add-on
Payment for the SAINT Neuromodulation System. As one of the first two hospitals in the United States to receive a SAINT
system, the equipment was installed at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) on May 9-10, 2024. Our
physicians and staff were trained by the manufacturer on May 15-17, 2024. We initiated treatment of our first patient
on May 23, 2024. This was an aggressive timeline for us and we were pleased to treat one of the first patients in the
United States. We hope that this program that for the first time allows innovation for inpatient mental health patients
will continue to be available to hospitals on the IPPS in 2026.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment. If you have any additional questions, please contact me.
Sincerely,
Baron Short, MD, MSCR
