To Whom It May Concern,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback regarding the FAAâ€™s consideration of
changes to the public availability of registered aircraft owner information.
1. How often do people or organizations access or use registered owner
information, and how is this information used?
Registered owner information is frequently accessed by airport senior
management and is critical for monitoring who is using the airport. The data
is imperative in predicting and identifying business opportunities and service
needs, such as air service development, and expanded charter and flight
operations.
4. How should the FAA implement the removal of identified categories of
registered owner information from public availability?
Should the FAA proceed with limiting data availability, we recommend a tiered
access approach. Sensitive personal details could be redacted from public
view while preserving full access for verified users through a secure portal.
In summary, it is essential to maintain access to aircraft ownership data for key
stakeholders while carefully addressing privacy concerns.
Sincerely,
Dawoud Stevenson
Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport
