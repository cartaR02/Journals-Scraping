SUBJECT: 2000 National Inventory of Large Municipal Waste Combustion (MWC) Units
~
This memorandum presents a year 2000 national inventory of large municipal waste
combustion (MWC) units. This inventory is an update of the earlier 1995 inventory of large
MWCs'. This 2000 inventory represents MWC units that are affected by the Subpart Cb
emission guidelines for large MWC units'. The Subpart Cb emission guidelines were adopted
December 19. 1995. States where large MWCs are located were required under Section 129 of
the Clean Air Act (CAA) to adopt and implement a State plan that assures all large MWC units
in the State are in compliance with the emission guidelines by December 19.2000. Many States
adopted State plans, as listed in 40 CFR part 62. EPA adopted a Federal plan to assure
compliance for large MWC units not covered by an approved State plan.' In this inventory and
Subpart Cb. a large MWC unit is defined as an MWC unit with a municipal solid waste (MSW)
combustion capacity greater than250 tons per day.
This 2000 national inventory is based on updated data submitted by large -MWC units
following maximum achievable control technology (MACT) compliance in December 2000. In
creating the 2000 inventory. the previous large MWC database was updated including changes to
-
reflect MWC plant closings. combustor type. combustion unit capacity. and air pollution control
device used kyear 2000 to comply with MACT requirements.
Table A-1 provides summary information for each MWC type. In 2000, the large MWC
category contains 167 units distributed into two groups of combustion unit types as follows:
133 mass bum units and 34refuse-derived fuel units. Table A-2 shows the change that has
occurred in the large MWC population since 1995.

Table B presents the MWC-specific data for year 2000 for this large MWC unit ~ t i o d
inventory. This includes: plant location, plant capacity. number of large MWC unitsat each
plant. iarge MWC unit capacity, large MWC unit type, air pollution control equipment,
construction date, and start-up date. There are 167 large MWC unitsin the 2000 inventory
located at 66 MWC plants with a total national operating capacity of 89,477 tons per day MSW.
Compared to the 1995 large MWC national inventory’.this shows a 2 percent increase in the
number of large MWC units (from 164 to 167). a 5 percent increase in the number of plants
(from 63 to 66 plants), and a 1 percent increase in capacity (from 88,652 to 89,477 tpd)for large
MWC units.
By location, the States with the most large MWC unitsare Florida (29 units),New York
(1 8 units). and Pennsylvania (1 6 Units), and Massachusetts (6 units). On a regional basis, the
EPA regions with the most large MWC units areEPA Region 4 (39 units), Region 3 (33 units),
and Region 1 (31 units)4.

Compared to the 1995 large MWC national inventory1, this shows a 2 percent increase in the
