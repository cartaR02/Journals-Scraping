Re: Request for Comment to Withhold Certain Aircraft Registration Information From Public
Dissemination – Docket FAA-2025-0638
Please find the following comments below from the Florida Department of Revenue regarding
the proposed changes to withhold certain aircraft registration information from public
dissemination, as outlined in the Federal Register notice published on April 3, 2025, with the
comment period extended to June 4, 2025 (Federal Register).
Support for Privacy Protections
The Florida Department of Revenue (FDOR) supports the FAA’s commitment to protecting the
personally identifiable information (PII) of private aircraft owners, as mandated by Section 803
of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. In an era where data misuse poses significant risks, the
option for owners to withhold their data through the Civil Aviation Registry Electronic Services
(CARES) system is a vital step toward enhancing privacy (FAA Newsroom). This initiative aligns
with broader societal demands for robust data protection and deserves commendation.
Critical Threat to Florida’s Tax Enforcement
However, we would like to highlight the negative impact this proposal could have on the FDOR,
which relies on publicly available aircraft registration data to monitor ownership changes
indicative of aircraft sales subject to Florida sales tax. This data is not merely a tool—it is the
backbone of Florida’s ability to enforce tax compliance on high-value transactions like aircraft
sales. Without access to this information, the state faces:
• Substantial Revenue Losses: The inability to track aircraft sales could result in millions
of dollars in uncollected sales tax, depriving Florida of critical funds for public services
such as education, infrastructure, and healthcare.
• Unfair Competition and Inequity: Non-compliant taxpayers could exploit the lack of
data to evade taxes, creating an uneven playing field where law-abiding businesses and
individuals are unfairly penalized. This undermines the fundamental principle of tax
equity, allowing some to gain an unjust advantage.
• Erosion of Public Trust: A tax system that fails to enforce compliance equitably risks
losing public confidence, as citizens and businesses expect fairness and accountability
in tax administration.
Aircraft sales represent significant taxable events, and ensuring their proper taxation is essential
for maintaining a just and equitable tax system. Restricting access to this data would not only
hamper enforcement but also create opportunities for tax evasion, directly contradicting the
principles of fairness that underpin Florida’s tax policies.
Ensuring a Level Playing Field
A fair tax system demands that all taxpayers and businesses, regardless of their resources or
industry, are held to the same standards of compliance. The FAA’s proposal, while well-
intentioned, risks dismantling this equity by limiting access to critical data needed to monitor
aircraft sales. Without this information, Florida cannot ensure that all taxpayers contribute their
fair share, potentially allowing some individuals or entities to evade taxes while compliant
taxpayers bear the burden.
Stakeholder Perspectives
Organizations like the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) have long advocated for
enhanced privacy protections, particularly following the ADS-B mandate in 2020, which
increased public tracking capabilities (AOPA). However, other stakeholders, including state tax
authorities and entities involved in aviation safety and commerce, have raised concerns about
the broader implications of restricting data access. The FAA’s call for comments, with 331
submissions received by May 5, 2025, underscores the complexity of balancing privacy with
regulatory needs (Federal Register). This feedback highlights the need for a solution that
addresses both privacy and the operational requirements of state agencies.
Proposed Solutions
To reconcile the FAA’s privacy objectives with the critical needs of state tax authorities, FDOR
proposes the following measures:
1. Secure Data Access Portal: Establish a restricted, secure portal through which verified
state agencies, such as the FDOR, can access aircraft registration data. This would
ensure that PII is protected from public dissemination while allowing legitimate regulatory
functions to continue uninterrupted.
2. Data-Sharing Agreements: Develop formal agreements between the FAA and state
governments to provide controlled access to registration data for tax enforcement
purposes. These agreements could include strict protocols to safeguard PII while
meeting state needs.
3. Stakeholder Engagement: Convene discussions with state tax administrators to fully
understand their data requirements and collaboratively design solutions that balance
privacy and regulatory demands.
4. Opt-In Data Sharing: Allow aircraft owners to opt-in to sharing specific data with state
agencies for regulatory purposes, providing flexibility while maintaining privacy
protections.
Impact Assessment
The following table summarizes the potential impacts of the FAA’s proposal and the benefits of
adopting secure data access solutions:

Conclusion
The proposed restriction of aircraft registration data poses a threat to Florida’s tax compliance
efforts, risking significant revenue losses and creating opportunities for tax evasion that
undermine fairness. FDOR requests the consideration of secure data access solutions, such as
restricted portals or data-sharing agreements and supports engagement with state tax
authorities and other stakeholders to develop a balanced approach that respects privacy while
preserving the integrity of the tax system.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this critical issue. FDOR strongly encourages the
FAA to prioritize solutions that support both privacy and regulatory fairness.
