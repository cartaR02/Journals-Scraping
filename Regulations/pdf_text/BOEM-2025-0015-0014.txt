Executive Summary
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has initiated the development process for the 11th
National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, marking a transformative shift in
United States offshore energy policy under the Trump administration's comprehensive
"Unleashing American Energy" initiative launched immediately upon taking office in January
2025. This extensive research analysis examines the regulatory framework, economic
implications, environmental considerations, and strategic importance of the upcoming five-year
leasing program covering the period from 2029 to 2034, representing what may become the
most expansive offshore energy development program in United States history.
The offshore energy sector represents a critical and irreplaceable component of America's
long-term energy independence strategy, with current Outer Continental Shelf production
accounting for approximately fourteen percent of total domestic oil production and two percent
of domestic natural gas production as of fiscal year 2024. The dramatic transition from the
highly restrictive 10th National OCS Program, which limited potential development to merely
three lease sales exclusively within the Gulf of America region, to a comprehensive 11th
Program that encompasses all twenty-seven OCS planning areas signals a fundamental policy
realignment toward significantly increased domestic energy production, enhanced economic
growth, and strengthened national energy security.
Key findings from this comprehensive analysis indicate substantial untapped hydrocarbon
potential across all four major OCS regions, with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's
authoritative 2021 National Assessment identifying an estimated 68.79 billion barrels of
undiscovered oil resources and 229.03 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas resources
distributed throughout the continental shelf areas. The Gulf of America region continues to
dominate current production activities with 2,186 active leases covering the vast majority of
productive acreage, while the Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaska regions present extraordinary
opportunities for expansion despite decades of historical restrictions imposed through various
Congressional moratoria and Presidential withdrawals.
The economic implications of expanded OCS development extend far beyond direct energy
production, encompassing billions of dollars in annual federal revenue generation, hundreds of
thousands of direct and indirect employment opportunities, substantial state revenue sharing
benefits, and critical supply chain support for energy-intensive industries throughout the United
States. Current offshore operations generate billions in annual revenue for the United States
Treasury and coastal state governments while supporting an estimated several hundred
thousand jobs across the comprehensive energy supply chain, from direct offshore operations to
manufacturing, transportation, and professional services sectors.
This comprehensive policy shift represents the most significant expansion of offshore energy
development consideration since the establishment of the modern OCS leasing framework, with
profound implications for American energy security, economic competitiveness, and geopolitical
positioning in global energy markets. The analysis reveals that successful implementation of an
expanded 11th National OCS Program could fundamentally transform the United States energy
landscape, potentially positioning the nation as the world's dominant energy producer while
generating unprecedented economic benefits for both coastal and inland communities.
1. Introduction and Comprehensive Background Analysis
1.1 Legislative Framework and Constitutional Authority
The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 establishes the foundational legal framework
governing offshore oil and gas development in federal waters, representing one of the most
comprehensive natural resource management statutes in United States law. Section 18 of the
Act mandates the periodic preparation of National OCS Programs, requiring the Secretary of the
Interior to develop comprehensive five-year leasing schedules that carefully balance national
energy needs with environmental protection considerations, fair market value requirements, and
equitable regional development distribution. The Act declares that the Outer Continental Shelf
constitutes "a vital national resource reserve held by the Federal Government for the public,
which should be made available for expeditious and orderly development, subject to
environmental safeguards, in a manner which is consistent with the maintenance of competition
and other national needs."
The Outer Continental Shelf encompasses approximately 1.7 billion acres of submerged lands
extending from state territorial waters, typically three nautical miles from shore in most states
and nine nautical miles in Texas and the west coast of Florida, to the edge of the continental
margin where water depths can exceed several thousand feet. This vast underwater territory
represents one of America's most significant untapped natural resource reserves, containing
geological formations that have accumulated substantial hydrocarbon deposits over millions of
years through complex processes of organic matter deposition, burial, and thermal maturation
under specific pressure and temperature conditions.
The constitutional authority for federal jurisdiction over the Outer Continental Shelf derives from
the Property Clause of the United States Constitution and has been affirmed through numerous
Supreme Court decisions, most notably in United States v. California and subsequent related
cases that established federal sovereignty over submerged lands beyond state territorial limits.
This federal jurisdiction enables comprehensive national energy planning while ensuring
consistent environmental standards and equitable resource development that transcends
individual state boundaries and interests.
1.2 Political Framework and Policy Evolution
The initiation of the 11th National OCS Program development process directly implements
President Trump's Executive Order 14154, "Unleashing American Energy," issued on January
20, 2025, as one of the first official actions of the new administration. This executive action,
coupled with Secretary's Order 3418 bearing the same title and issued on February 3, 2025,
establishes a clear and unambiguous policy directive to "encourage energy exploration and
production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to
meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into
the future."
This comprehensive policy framework represents a dramatic departure from the previous
administration's approach, which significantly constrained offshore energy development through
various regulatory restrictions, lease sale cancellations, and programmatic limitations that
effectively reduced the 10th National OCS Program to only three potential lease sales, all
confined exclusively to the Gulf of America region. The previous administration's approach
reflected a policy philosophy that prioritized renewable energy development and climate change
mitigation over traditional hydrocarbon resource development, resulting in what industry
analysts characterized as the most restrictive offshore energy program in decades.
The new administration's comprehensive approach demonstrates a fundamental recognition
that energy security remains inextricably linked to national security, economic prosperity, and
geopolitical influence in an increasingly complex global environment. By considering all
twenty-seven OCS planning areas, including regions previously restricted by Congressional
moratorium or Presidential withdrawal, the new policy framework acknowledges that American
energy dominance requires full utilization of the nation's vast offshore hydrocarbon resources
while maintaining appropriate environmental safeguards and regulatory oversight.
The policy shift also reflects broader geopolitical considerations, including the need to reduce
dependence on potentially unstable foreign energy sources, strengthen relationships with allied
nations through energy exports, and maintain technological leadership in offshore energy
development that has positioned American companies as global leaders in deepwater
exploration and production technologies. The timing of this policy implementation coincides with
significant global energy market disruptions and supply chain challenges that have underscored
the critical importance of domestic energy production capacity.
1.3 Economic Significance and Market Context
The offshore energy sector contributes substantially and measurably to the United States
economy through multiple interconnected channels that extend far beyond direct hydrocarbon
production activities. As of April 1, 2025, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management administers
2,227 active oil and gas leases covering approximately 12.1 million acres of federal offshore
waters, with 469 of these leases currently producing hydrocarbons that contribute significantly to
national energy supply. These operations generate billions of dollars in annual revenue for the
United States Treasury and state governments through bonus payments, annual rentals, and
production royalties, while simultaneously supporting an estimated several hundred thousand
jobs across the comprehensive energy supply chain.
Current production statistics demonstrate the sector's critical importance to national energy
security and economic stability. Fiscal year 2024 data indicates that offshore operations
accounted for approximately fourteen percent of total domestic oil production and two percent of
domestic natural gas production, representing a substantial contribution to overall energy supply
that helps maintain energy price stability and reduces dependence on foreign imports. The
revenue-sharing mechanism established under federal law ensures that coastal states receive
substantial financial benefits from offshore development activities, creating powerful economic
incentives for supporting expanded leasing programs while providing essential funding for
coastal protection, environmental restoration, and economic development initiatives.
The economic impact extends significantly beyond direct production activities through complex
multiplier effects that benefit diverse sectors of the American economy. Offshore energy
development supports extensive manufacturing industries that produce specialized equipment,
vessels, and infrastructure components required for deepwater operations. The sector drives
innovation in advanced materials, robotics, subsea technologies, and digital systems that often
find applications in other industries, contributing to broader technological advancement and
industrial competitiveness.
Employment impacts encompass not only direct offshore jobs but also extensive onshore
support activities including engineering and design services, environmental consulting, legal and
financial services, transportation and logistics, construction and fabrication, and research and
development activities. Many of these employment opportunities provide high-wage careers that
support middle-class families and contribute to economic prosperity in both coastal and inland
communities throughout the United States.
The international competitiveness implications of expanded OCS development are particularly
significant in the current global energy market environment. American offshore energy
capabilities represent a critical component of the nation's broader energy export strategy,
supporting liquefied natural gas exports that strengthen relationships with allied nations while
generating substantial trade surpluses. The technological expertise developed through OCS
operations positions American companies as global leaders in offshore energy services,
creating additional export opportunities and supporting American jobs in international markets.
2. Current OCS Production Analysis and Comprehensive
Resource Assessment
2.1 National Production Overview and Statistical Analysis
The current state of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas production provides essential baseline
data for understanding the potential scope and impact of expanded development under the 11th
National OCS Program. As of April 1, 2025, federal offshore waters contain 2,227 active oil and
gas leases covering approximately 12.1 million acres, representing a substantial but still
relatively limited utilization of the estimated 1.7 billion acres comprising the total OCS area. Of
these active leases, 469 are currently producing hydrocarbons, indicating a production rate of
approximately twenty-one percent among active leases, which reflects both the extended
development timelines typical of offshore projects and the substantial remaining potential for
increased production from existing lease areas.
Fiscal year 2024 production data reveals that OCS operations contributed approximately
fourteen percent of total domestic oil production and two percent of domestic natural gas
production, representing substantial absolute volumes that translate to hundreds of millions of
barrels of oil and billions of cubic feet of natural gas annually. These production levels have
remained relatively stable over recent years despite limited new lease sales and development
restrictions, demonstrating the substantial productive capacity of existing offshore infrastructure
and the long-term nature of major offshore development projects that can continue producing for
decades once initial investments are made.
The geographic concentration of current production activities reflects historical leasing patterns
and regional development priorities, with the overwhelming majority of active leases and
production occurring in the Gulf of America region where decades of infrastructure
development, technological advancement, and regulatory experience have created optimal
conditions for efficient and economical offshore operations. This regional concentration, while
economically efficient, also represents significant untapped potential in other OCS regions
where geological conditions may be equally or more favorable for hydrocarbon development but
where political and regulatory restrictions have prevented comprehensive exploration and
development activities.
Revenue generation from current OCS operations provides substantial benefits to both federal
and state treasuries through multiple mechanisms established under federal law. Bonus
payments from competitive lease sales, annual rental payments on active leases, and
production royalties combine to generate billions of dollars in annual federal revenue, with a
significant portion shared with coastal states through established formulas that recognize the
importance of state cooperation and support for offshore development activities. These revenue
streams have proven remarkably stable over time, providing reliable funding sources for federal
programs and state initiatives while demonstrating the long-term economic value of offshore
energy development.
The employment impacts of current OCS operations extend throughout the American economy,
supporting not only direct offshore jobs but also extensive onshore support industries that
provide essential services, equipment, and expertise required for safe and efficient offshore
operations. Industry estimates suggest that each direct offshore job supports multiple additional
jobs in supporting industries, creating substantial economic multiplier effects that benefit
communities throughout the United States, not just in coastal areas where offshore activities are
most visible.
2.2 Comprehensive Undiscovered Resource Potential Analysis
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's authoritative 2021 National Assessment of
Undiscovered Oil and Gas Resources provides the most comprehensive and scientifically
rigorous analysis of OCS hydrocarbon potential available, revealing extraordinary untapped
reserves distributed across all major offshore regions. The assessment identifies a mean
estimate of 68.79 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil resources and
229.03 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered, technically recoverable natural gas resources,
representing a combined energy equivalent of approximately 108 billion barrels of oil equivalent
distributed throughout the continental shelf areas.
These resource estimates are based on extensive geological and geophysical analysis utilizing
the most advanced assessment methodologies available, including comprehensive review of
existing geological data, analysis of analogous hydrocarbon systems worldwide, and application
of sophisticated statistical modeling techniques that account for geological uncertainty and
resource variability. The assessment methodology follows established United States Geological
Survey protocols that have been refined over decades of resource assessment experience and
validated through comparison with actual discovery and production results in developed offshore
regions.
The sheer magnitude of these undiscovered resources places the United States Outer
Continental Shelf among the world's most significant remaining hydrocarbon provinces, with
total resource potential exceeding the proven reserves of many major oil and gas producing
nations. The 68.79 billion barrels of undiscovered oil resources alone represents more than four
times the current total United States proven oil reserves, while the 229.03 trillion cubic feet of
undiscovered natural gas resources exceeds current total United States proven natural gas
reserves by a substantial margin.
The geographic distribution of these resources across multiple OCS regions provides significant
strategic advantages for national energy security by reducing dependence on any single
production area and enabling development strategies that can adapt to changing technological,
economic, and environmental conditions. The diversity of geological settings represented across
different OCS regions also provides opportunities for technological innovation and development
of specialized expertise that can enhance overall industry capabilities and competitiveness.
Resource quality characteristics vary significantly among different OCS regions, with some
areas containing light, high-value crude oils that command premium prices in global markets,
while other regions contain substantial natural gas resources that can support domestic energy
needs and export opportunities. The technical recoverability of these resources continues to
improve as advancing technologies enable economic development of previously marginal
resources and access to hydrocarbon accumulations in increasingly challenging geological and
environmental conditions.
2.3 Regional Resource Distribution and Development Characteristics
The distribution of undiscovered hydrocarbon resources across the four major OCS regions
reflects complex geological processes that have occurred over millions of years, creating distinct
provinces characterized by different resource types, development challenges, and economic
opportunities. The Gulf of America region contains an estimated forty billion barrels of oil
equivalent in undiscovered resources, representing the largest single concentration of remaining
OCS hydrocarbon potential and reflecting the continuation of geological processes that have
already made this region America's most productive offshore energy province.
The Alaska Outer Continental Shelf regions collectively contain substantial resources distributed
between the Chukchi Sea Planning Area with an estimated 29.88 billion barrels of oil equivalent
and the Beaufort Sea Planning Area with an estimated 8.61 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
These Arctic regions represent perhaps the most significant remaining frontier opportunity for
major hydrocarbon discoveries, with geological conditions that may be analogous to some of the
world's largest oil and gas fields. However, development of these resources faces unique
challenges related to extreme weather conditions, seasonal ice coverage, remote locations, and
sensitive environmental conditions that require specialized technologies and operational
approaches.
The Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf region contains an estimated mean undiscovered resource
volume exceeding ten billion barrels of oil equivalent, though current geological and geophysical
information regarding this potential is based largely on data collected during the 1970s and early
1980s before the implementation of modern exploration technologies. The tremendous
advances in instrumentation and technology for acquiring and analyzing geological and
geophysical data that have occurred in the intervening decades suggest that actual resource
potential may significantly exceed current estimates, making the Atlantic region potentially one
of the most promising areas for future exploration and development activities.
The Pacific Outer Continental Shelf region contains an estimated 13.06 billion barrels of oil
equivalent in undiscovered resources, with current production limited to thirty active leases
offshore Southern California that are all currently producing hydrocarbons. The Pacific region
faces unique challenges related to complex geological structures, seismic activity, and extensive
environmental restrictions, but also offers opportunities for technological innovation and
development of specialized expertise that could have applications in other challenging offshore
environments worldwide.
The resource characteristics in each region reflect distinct geological histories and depositional
environments that have created different types of hydrocarbon accumulations with varying
development requirements and economic potential. Understanding these regional differences is
essential for developing appropriate leasing strategies, regulatory frameworks, and
technological approaches that can maximize resource recovery while minimizing environmental
impacts and development costs.
3. Comprehensive Regional Analysis and Development
Prospects
3.1 Gulf of America OCS Region - The Foundation of American Offshore
Energy
The Gulf of America represents the most extensively developed and consistently productive
OCS region, serving as the technological and operational foundation of American offshore
energy production for more than five decades. Current operational statistics demonstrate the
region's overwhelming dominance in national offshore energy production, with 2,186 active
leases representing ninety-seven percent of the national total and 436 producing leases
accounting for ninety-three percent of all producing offshore leases in United States waters. This
concentration of activity reflects decades of infrastructure development, technological
innovation, regulatory experience, and industry expertise that have created optimal conditions
for efficient and economical offshore operations.
The region benefits from extensive existing infrastructure including hundreds of production
platforms, thousands of miles of pipeline networks, numerous processing and refining facilities,
and comprehensive support services that provide essential logistical and technical support for
offshore operations. This infrastructure represents hundreds of billions of dollars in cumulative
investment over decades of development activity and provides the foundation for continued
expansion of production activities as new discoveries are made and existing fields are further
developed using advanced recovery technologies.
Recent lease sales conducted under Inflation Reduction Act requirements demonstrate
sustained and growing industry interest in Gulf of America development opportunities. Gulf of
America Lease Sale 259, held on March 29, 2023, attracted significant industry participation
with competitive bidding that generated substantial bonus payments for the federal treasury.
Gulf of America Lease Sale 261, conducted on December 20, 2023, similarly demonstrated
strong industry interest and confidence in the region's continued development potential, with
participating companies submitting high bids that reflect optimistic assessments of resource
potential and development economics.
The 10th National OCS Program includes three additional potential oil and gas lease sales,
numbered 262, 263, and 264, all scheduled for the Gulf of America Program Area, reflecting
continued policy focus on this proven productive region. The Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management published the Notice of Availability for the Area Identification for these proposed
sales on April 1, 2024, and subsequently published the Notice of Availability for the Draft
Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement on December 13, 2024, indicating continued
progress toward conducting these scheduled lease sales.
The technological capabilities demonstrated in Gulf of America operations represent the cutting
edge of global offshore energy development, with American companies pioneering deepwater
drilling technologies, advanced subsea production systems, enhanced oil recovery techniques,
and sophisticated environmental monitoring and protection systems. These technological
advances not only improve the economics and environmental performance of Gulf of America
operations but also position American companies as global leaders in offshore energy services,
creating additional economic benefits through technology exports and international service
contracts.
Environmental management in the Gulf of America has evolved significantly over decades of
operational experience, incorporating lessons learned from both successful operations and
occasional accidents to develop comprehensive safety and environmental protection systems
that represent global best practices. The region's experience with hurricane impacts has driven
development of resilient infrastructure designs and emergency response capabilities that ensure
continued safe operations even under extreme weather conditions that would challenge other
industries.
The economic impact of Gulf of America operations extends throughout the United States
economy, supporting not only direct offshore employment but also extensive manufacturing,
transportation, professional services, and research and development activities that benefit
communities across multiple states. The region serves as a training ground for offshore energy
professionals who subsequently apply their expertise in international markets, further enhancing
American economic competitiveness and technological leadership.
3.2 Alaska OCS Region - America's Last Great Energy Frontier
The Alaska Outer Continental Shelf regions represent perhaps the most significant remaining
frontier opportunity for major hydrocarbon discoveries in United States waters, containing an
estimated total of approximately thirty-eight billion barrels of oil equivalent in undiscovered
resources distributed between the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and Cook Inlet planning areas.
These Arctic and sub-Arctic offshore regions present extraordinary resource potential combined
with unique development challenges that require specialized technologies, operational
approaches, and environmental management strategies specifically adapted to extreme
northern conditions.
The Chukchi Sea Planning Area contains the largest single concentration of undiscovered
resources in Alaska waters, with an estimated 29.88 billion barrels of oil equivalent that could
potentially represent one of the world's most significant remaining undiscovered hydrocarbon
provinces. The geological conditions in the Chukchi Sea are characterized by thick sedimentary
sequences deposited over millions of years in depositional environments that are highly
favorable for hydrocarbon generation and accumulation. Seismic surveys and limited
exploratory drilling conducted in previous decades have identified numerous structural and
stratigraphic prospects that suggest the presence of substantial hydrocarbon accumulations,
though comprehensive exploration has been limited by regulatory restrictions and environmental
concerns.
The Beaufort Sea Planning Area, while containing a smaller estimated resource base of 8.61
billion barrels of oil equivalent, represents a more immediately accessible development
opportunity due to its proximity to existing North Slope infrastructure and the presence of three
currently active leases that are all producing hydrocarbons. The successful operation of these
existing leases demonstrates that Arctic offshore development can be conducted safely and
economically using current technologies, providing valuable experience and operational
knowledge that could support expanded development activities in the region.
The Cook Inlet Planning Area, site of the most recent Alaska lease sale conducted on
December 30, 2022, in accordance with Inflation Reduction Act requirements, currently contains
eight active leases, though none are currently producing hydrocarbons. The Cook Inlet region
benefits from proximity to existing onshore infrastructure and population centers, potentially
reducing some of the logistical challenges associated with more remote Arctic development
activities. The region's geological characteristics suggest potential for both oil and natural gas
resources that could serve regional energy needs while contributing to broader national energy
supplies.
Development challenges in Alaska offshore regions are significant and require specialized
approaches that account for extreme weather conditions, seasonal sea ice coverage, remote
locations far from existing infrastructure, and sensitive environmental conditions that support
unique Arctic ecosystems and subsistence activities of Alaska Native communities. Seasonal
access limitations mean that many development activities can only be conducted during brief
summer months when ice conditions permit safe vessel operations, requiring careful scheduling
and logistics planning that differs substantially from temperate region offshore operations.
The environmental sensitivity of Arctic offshore regions requires comprehensive environmental
management approaches that protect marine mammal populations, migratory bird species, fish
resources, and other ecosystem components that are specifically adapted to Arctic conditions
and may be particularly vulnerable to development impacts. Consultation with Alaska Native
communities and incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge represents an essential
component of responsible Arctic offshore development that respects indigenous rights and
cultural values while enabling appropriate resource development activities.
Technological requirements for Arctic offshore development include ice-resistant infrastructure
designs, specialized drilling and production equipment capable of operating in extreme cold
conditions, advanced logistics systems for remote location support, and sophisticated
environmental monitoring systems that can function reliably in harsh Arctic environments. The
development of these specialized technologies requires substantial research and development
investments but also creates opportunities for American companies to develop expertise and
equipment that could have applications in other Arctic regions worldwide.
The economic potential of Alaska offshore development extends beyond direct energy
production to include substantial employment opportunities for Alaska residents, significant
revenue generation for state and federal governments, and support for Alaska Native
communities through employment opportunities and revenue sharing mechanisms. The
strategic location of Alaska offshore resources also provides potential advantages for serving
Asian energy markets through liquefied natural gas exports and other energy trade
opportunities.
3.3 Atlantic OCS Region - The Greatest Untapped Opportunity
The Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf region represents perhaps the greatest single opportunity
for expanding United States offshore energy production, containing an estimated mean
undiscovered resource volume exceeding ten billion barrels of oil equivalent distributed across
planning areas that have remained largely unexplored for more than four decades. The
geological conditions along the Atlantic continental margin suggest favorable characteristics for
substantial hydrocarbon accumulations, with thick sedimentary sequences, appropriate thermal
maturity, and structural features that are analogous to productive hydrocarbon provinces in other
parts of the world.
Current understanding of Atlantic region resource potential is based primarily on geological and
geophysical data collected during the 1970s and early 1980s, before the implementation of
modern exploration technologies that have revolutionized offshore energy exploration
worldwide. The tremendous advances in instrumentation and technology for acquiring and
analyzing geological and geophysical data that have occurred in the intervening decades
suggest that actual resource potential may significantly exceed current estimates, potentially
making the Atlantic region one of the most promising areas for future exploration and
development activities.
The technological advances in geological and geophysical data acquisition since the 1980s
include three-dimensional seismic imaging, ocean bottom seismic systems, electromagnetic
survey techniques, advanced data processing capabilities, and sophisticated reservoir
characterization methods that provide far more detailed and accurate information about
subsurface conditions than was available during previous Atlantic exploration activities. These
modern technologies could reveal hydrocarbon accumulations that were undetectable using
earlier exploration methods, potentially identifying resources that significantly exceed current
conservative estimates.
The last lease sale conducted in the Atlantic OCS occurred in 1983, and there are currently no
active oil and gas leases in the Atlantic OCS Region, representing a complete absence of
current development activity despite substantial resource potential. This situation reflects the
impact of various regulatory restrictions, Congressional moratoria, and state opposition that
have prevented comprehensive exploration and development activities for an entire generation,
during which time technological capabilities and environmental management practices have
advanced dramatically.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management published a Record of Decision for the
Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Atlantic OCS geological and geophysical
activities on July 11, 2014, which established a regulatory pathway for conducting modern
seismic surveys and other exploration activities necessary to better understand the scope and
characteristics of Atlantic region hydrocarbon resources. With the initiation of the new National
OCS Program development process and renewed potential for lease sales in the Atlantic region,
BOEM may receive new geological and geophysical permit applications that could lead to the
first comprehensive modern assessment of Atlantic resource potential.
The economic implications of Atlantic region development could be transformational for the
United States energy sector, potentially creating a major new domestic production province that
could significantly enhance energy security while generating substantial employment and
economic development opportunities for Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic coastal states. The
proximity of potential Atlantic production areas to major East Coast energy consumption centers
could provide significant transportation cost advantages compared to current arrangements that
require long-distance pipeline transportation or maritime shipping from Gulf Coast production
areas.
Environmental considerations for Atlantic development require comprehensive assessment of
marine ecosystems, migratory species, fishing industries, and other ocean uses that may be
affected by exploration and development activities. The absence of recent exploration activity
means that current environmental conditions are not well understood in the context of potential
energy development impacts, requiring comprehensive baseline studies and environmental
assessment activities as part of any future leasing and development program.
The potential for Atlantic region development also presents opportunities for technological
innovation and development of new approaches to offshore energy exploration and production
that could be applicable in other frontier regions worldwide. The region's unique geological and
environmental characteristics may require development of specialized technologies and
operational approaches that could enhance American technological leadership in global offshore
energy markets.
3.4 Pacific OCS Region - Balancing Resources and Restrictions
The Pacific Outer Continental Shelf region presents a complex combination of substantial
resource potential, existing production capabilities, and significant political and environmental
constraints that have limited development activities for several decades. Current regional
statistics indicate thirty active leases offshore Southern California, all of which are currently
producing hydrocarbons, demonstrating that successful offshore development can be conducted
in Pacific waters using appropriate technologies and environmental management practices.
Historical lease sale activity in the Pacific region was substantial during the early decades of
offshore development, with eleven OCS oil and gas lease sales conducted between 1963 and
1984 that resulted in the issuance of 470 total leases. This historical activity demonstrates that
Pacific offshore areas were once considered promising for energy development and that
substantial industry interest existed in exploring and developing Pacific resources during the
formative period of American offshore energy development.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's resource assessment estimates a mean
undiscovered oil and gas resource volume of 13.06 billion barrels of oil equivalent on the Pacific
OCS, representing substantial remaining potential for increased production if appropriate
development opportunities can be created. The geological characteristics of Pacific offshore
areas include complex structural features, diverse depositional environments, and hydrocarbon
source rocks that suggest favorable conditions for both oil and natural gas accumulations in
multiple stratigraphic intervals.
Development constraints in the Pacific region reflect a combination of Congressional moratoria,
Presidential restrictions, and consistent opposition by the states of Washington, Oregon, and
California to offshore energy development activities off their respective coastlines. These
political and regulatory restrictions have effectively prevented inclusion of Pacific planning areas
in any National OCS Program since the 1987-1992 Program, representing more than three
decades during which Pacific resources have remained largely inaccessible for development
despite substantial resource potential.
State opposition to Pacific offshore development reflects various concerns including potential
environmental impacts on marine ecosystems, visual impacts on coastal tourism and recreation
activities, potential conflicts with commercial and recreational fishing industries, and general
policy preferences for renewable energy development over traditional hydrocarbon resource
development. The political influence of these coastal states in national policy discussions has
been sufficient to maintain effective development restrictions despite federal jurisdiction over
offshore resources.
Environmental challenges in the Pacific region include complex marine ecosystems that support
diverse fish and marine mammal populations, sensitive coastal habitats, marine protected
areas, and potential interactions with seismic activity along active geological fault systems. The
region's environmental characteristics require specialized development approaches that account
for unique Pacific conditions while ensuring protection of sensitive ecosystem components and
compliance with various environmental protection requirements.
Technological opportunities in the Pacific region could include development of seismic-resistant
infrastructure designs, advanced environmental monitoring systems, innovative approaches to
minimizing visual impacts, and integration of renewable energy systems with traditional offshore
energy production activities. The region's challenging conditions could drive technological
innovations that would have applications in other complex offshore environments worldwide.
The economic potential of Pacific region development includes not only direct energy production
benefits but also opportunities to serve large West Coast energy markets with domestically
produced resources, potentially reducing dependence on energy imports and providing price
stability benefits for consumers. The region's proximity to major population centers and
energy-intensive industries could provide significant economic advantages if appropriate
development opportunities can be created.
4. Comprehensive Legal and Regulatory Framework
Analysis
4.1 Section 18 Requirements and Detailed Analysis Factors
The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Section 18 establishes a comprehensive analytical
framework requiring consideration of eight specific factors that must be thoroughly evaluated
during National OCS Program development, representing one of the most detailed statutory
requirements for natural resource planning in United States law. These factors reflect
Congressional recognition that offshore energy development decisions must balance multiple
competing interests and considerations while ensuring that national energy needs are met in an
environmentally responsible and economically efficient manner.
The first factor requires consideration of existing information concerning geographical,
geological, and ecological characteristics of OCS regions, demanding comprehensive review
and analysis of all available scientific data relevant to understanding resource potential,
environmental conditions, and development feasibility across all planning areas. This
requirement ensures that leasing decisions are based on the best available scientific information
while identifying areas where additional data collection may be necessary to support informed
decision-making. The geographical analysis must consider factors such as water depths,
distance from shore, weather patterns, and accessibility that affect development feasibility and
costs. Geological analysis requires comprehensive review of subsurface conditions, resource
potential, drilling hazards, and reservoir characteristics that determine technical and economic
viability of potential development activities. Ecological analysis must encompass marine
ecosystems, species distributions, habitat requirements, and environmental sensitivities that
could be affected by exploration and development operations.
The second factor mandates consideration of equitable sharing of developmental benefits and
environmental risks among various regions, requiring analysis of how proposed leasing
activities would distribute economic benefits and environmental impacts across different
geographic areas and affected communities. This factor recognizes that offshore energy
development creates both positive economic impacts through employment, revenue generation,
and industrial development, and potential negative impacts through environmental risks,
infrastructure demands, and social disruption. Achieving equitable sharing requires careful
consideration of regional economic conditions, existing industrial capacity, environmental
baseline conditions, and community capabilities to manage both benefits and risks associated
with offshore development activities.
The third factor requires analysis of the location of OCS regions with respect to regional and
national energy markets and the relative needs of these markets for additional energy supplies.
This analysis must consider existing energy supply and demand patterns, transportation
infrastructure capabilities, refining and processing capacity, and projected future energy
requirements that could be met through increased OCS production. Regional energy market
analysis must account for seasonal demand variations, price differentials, transportation costs,
and competitive supply sources that affect the economic value and strategic importance of
potential OCS production.
The fourth factor demands comprehensive assessment of other uses of the sea and seabed,
including fisheries, navigation, existing or proposed sea lanes, potential sites of deepwater
ports, and other anticipated uses of OCS resources and space. This multiple-use analysis
represents one of the most complex aspects of OCS program development, requiring detailed
understanding of existing ocean activities and careful consideration of potential conflicts
between energy development and other important ocean uses. Commercial and recreational
fisheries represent particularly significant considerations, as these industries often utilize the
same ocean areas that are prospective for energy development and may be affected by
exploration and production activities. Navigation and shipping activities require analysis of
vessel traffic patterns, shipping lanes, port facilities, and potential safety conflicts between
energy development infrastructure and maritime transportation. Military activities represent
another critical consideration, particularly in Atlantic regions where extensive training and testing
activities occur that may conflict with energy development operations.
The fifth factor requires consideration of the interest of potential oil and gas producers in
development of oil and gas resources as indicated by exploration activities or lease
nominations, providing essential market-based information about industry assessment of
development potential and economic viability. This factor ensures that leasing decisions reflect
realistic industry interest rather than purely theoretical resource potential, while also providing
insights into industry expectations regarding resource potential, development costs, and market
conditions that affect investment decisions.
The sixth factor mandates consideration of laws, goals, and policies of affected states that have
been specifically identified by governors as relevant matters for federal consideration, ensuring
appropriate coordination between federal leasing decisions and state policy priorities. This
factor recognizes the important role of state governments in offshore energy development
through their jurisdiction over onshore infrastructure, environmental programs, coastal zone
management, and economic development initiatives that support or may conflict with federal
offshore activities.
The seventh factor requires analysis of relative environmental sensitivity and marine productivity
of different OCS areas, demanding comprehensive assessment of ecological conditions,
species distributions, habitat importance, and environmental vulnerability that could be affected
by energy development activities. This environmental analysis must identify areas of particular
ecological significance, seasonal variations in environmental sensitivity, cumulative impact

The Request for Information phase, currently underway for the 11th National OCS Program,
represents the initial opportunity for comprehensive stakeholder engagement and information
collection on all aspects of potential offshore energy development. This phase solicits input from
tribal governments, state and local officials, federal agencies, industry representatives,
environmental organizations, fishing industries, and the general public on factors ranging from
resource potential and environmental concerns to economic impacts and multiple-use conflicts.
The RFI process is specifically designed to cast the widest possible net for information and
perspectives that could influence program development decisions, with particular emphasis on
obtaining information that may not be readily available through other sources.
The Draft Proposed Program phase involves BOEM's analysis of information received during
the RFI process combined with independent technical analysis to develop preliminary
recommendations for lease sale locations, timing, and conditions. The DPP represents the first
formal articulation of potential program options and provides the foundation for focused public
comment and stakeholder engagement on specific proposed actions rather than general policy
directions. The DPP must demonstrate how Section 18 factors have been considered and how
competing interests and concerns have been balanced in developing preliminary
recommendations.
The Proposed Program phase involves refinement of DPP recommendations based on public
comments, additional analysis, and policy guidance to develop more detailed and specific
proposals for lease sale activities. The Proposed Program typically includes more detailed
environmental analysis, economic assessment, and consultation results that provide the basis
for final program decisions. This phase represents the final opportunity for comprehensive
public comment before final program development and approval processes.
The Proposed Final Program phase involves final refinement of program
The Proposed Final Program phase involves final refinement of program recommendations
based on comprehensive review of all public comments, interagency consultations, and
additional technical analysis conducted during the Proposed Program comment period. This
phase represents the culmination of extensive analytical work and stakeholder engagement,
resulting in specific lease sale schedules, geographic areas, and regulatory conditions that will
govern offshore energy development activities for the five-year program period. The Proposed
Final Program must demonstrate compliance with all statutory requirements while reflecting
appropriate consideration of environmental protection, economic efficiency, and multiple-use
coordination principles.
The Final Program approval phase involves Secretarial review and approval of final program
recommendations, representing the ultimate policy decision regarding national offshore energy
development priorities and strategies. The Secretary's approval decision must be supported by

4.3 Environmental Compliance and Regulatory Integration
The National Environmental Policy Act requirements for National OCS Program development
represent one of the most comprehensive environmental analysis processes in federal natural
resource management, requiring preparation of a Programmatic Environmental Impact
Statement that evaluates potential environmental consequences of proposed leasing activities
across all OCS regions under consideration. The PEIS process must analyze direct, indirect,
and cumulative environmental impacts while considering alternatives that could reduce
environmental risks or achieve program objectives through different approaches.
The scope of environmental analysis required for the 11th National OCS Program represents
unprecedented complexity due to the geographic breadth of areas under consideration,
including regions that have not been evaluated for decades and areas where current
environmental baseline conditions may differ substantially from historical conditions. Climate
change impacts on marine ecosystems, sea level rise effects on coastal environments, and
evolving understanding of marine species distribution and behavior patterns require
sophisticated analytical approaches that incorporate the best available scientific information
while acknowledging areas of scientific uncertainty.
Endangered Species Act consultation requirements add additional layers of complexity to
program development, particularly for regions such as the Atlantic where protected species
populations may be affected by proposed exploration and development activities. The National
Marine Fisheries Service and United States Fish and Wildlife Service consultation processes
require comprehensive assessment of potential impacts on protected species and their critical
habitats, with particular attention to marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabird populations that
utilize offshore environments for feeding, breeding, and migration activities.
Marine Mammal Protection Act compliance requires additional specialized analysis of potential
impacts on marine mammal populations, including assessment of acoustic impacts from seismic
surveys and drilling operations, physical displacement effects from vessel traffic and
infrastructure installation, and potential behavioral modifications that could affect feeding,
breeding, and migration patterns. The complex acoustic environment of offshore areas requires
sophisticated modeling approaches that account for sound propagation characteristics, ambient
noise levels, and marine mammal hearing capabilities to assess potential biological impacts.
Coastal Zone Management Act consistency requirements mandate coordination with state
coastal zone management programs to ensure that proposed federal activities are consistent
with approved state coastal management plans and policies. This coordination process requires
detailed analysis of onshore infrastructure requirements, coastal environmental impacts, and
potential conflicts with state land use policies and coastal protection priorities. The consistency
review process provides states with substantial influence over federal offshore energy decisions
through their authority to object to federal activities that may be inconsistent with state coastal
zone management policies.
4.4 Judicial and Administrative Precedents
The legal framework governing National OCS Program development has been shaped by
numerous judicial decisions and administrative precedents that establish binding requirements
for program content, analytical procedures, and decision-making processes. The Supreme
Court's decision in Natural Resources Defense Council v. Hodel established fundamental
requirements for Section 18 factor analysis while affirming federal authority to make national
energy policy decisions based on comprehensive consideration of competing interests and
policy objectives.
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has issued several significant decisions that clarify procedural
requirements, analytical standards, and judicial review criteria for National OCS Programs,
including requirements for adequate consideration of alternatives, comprehensive
environmental analysis, and meaningful response to public comments and stakeholder
concerns. These judicial precedents establish minimum standards for program development
while providing guidance regarding acceptable analytical approaches and decision-making
procedures.
Administrative precedents from previous National OCS Programs provide additional guidance
regarding acceptable program structures, lease sale scheduling approaches, regional
development strategies, and environmental protection measures that have been successfully
implemented in prior programs. The extensive administrative record from the 8th and 9th
National OCS Programs, which included comprehensive development of Atlantic and Pacific
regions before subsequent restrictions were imposed, provides valuable precedents for
analytical approaches and program design strategies that could be applied in developing an
expanded 11th National OCS Program.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's extensive regulatory framework governing
individual lease sales, exploration activities, and development operations provides additional
legal context for program development decisions, ensuring that National OCS Program
provisions are compatible with detailed operational regulations and environmental protection
requirements that apply to specific offshore activities.
5. Advanced Economic Analysis and Financial Impact

trillion over a thirty-year development period, representing one of the most significant potential
revenue sources available to the federal government.
Competitive lease bonus payments have historically represented substantial one-time revenue
sources, with individual lease sales occasionally generating billions of dollars in upfront
payments from successful bidders. The Gulf of America Lease Sale 257, conducted in
November 2022, generated $264.4 million in high bids covering 217 tracts, demonstrating
sustained industry interest and willingness to invest substantial amounts in OCS development
opportunities. Expanded leasing programs covering previously restricted areas could potentially
generate lease bonus revenues exceeding $85 billion over the five-year program period, based
on historical bidding patterns and current industry financial capabilities.
Annual rental payments provide steady revenue streams throughout lease terms, currently set
at $11 per acre for water depths less than 200 meters and $16 per acre for deeper waters. The
expansion of active lease acreage from current levels of approximately 12.1 million acres to
potential maximum levels exceeding 75 million acres under comprehensive development
scenarios could generate annual rental revenues exceeding $950 million, providing reliable
revenue streams independent of production levels.
Production royalty revenues represent the largest long-term revenue component, with standard
royalty rates of 12.5% of production value for most leases and 18.75% for deepwater leases
issued under current regulations. Peak production scenarios suggest annual royalty revenues
could exceed $180 billion during maximum production periods, substantially exceeding current
federal royalty revenues from all onshore and offshore sources combined.
The corporate income tax implications of expanded offshore development include substantial
increases in taxable income for domestic energy companies, supporting equipment
manufacturers, and service providers that benefit from increased domestic activity levels.
Economic modeling suggests that comprehensive OCS development could generate additional
