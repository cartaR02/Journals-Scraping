RE: 42 CFR Parts 412, 413, 495, and 512; CMS-1833-P; Comments on Neuroguard® IEP
System New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) Application
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the FY2026 IPPS Proposed Rule. This letter
addresses the comments from CMS regarding Contego Medical, Inc.'s application for a New
Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for the Neuroguard® Integrated Embolic Protection (IEP)
System. Contego Medical, Inc. is a medical device company focused on developing
innovative solutions for carotid and peripheral vascular disease. The Neuroguard IEP System
is manufactured by Contego. Medtronic is the sole U.S. distributor for Contego's portfolio of
commercially available products, including the Neuroguard IEP System.
BACKGROUND
The Neuroguard IEP System represents a groundbreaking advancement in carotid artery
stenting (CAS) with a novel 3-in-1 design combining a carotid stent, post-dilation balloon,
and 40-micron pore integrated embolic filter in one device, with a revolutionary mechanism
of action that directly addresses the primary limitation of traditional carotid stenting
technologies, thereby providing embolic protection that could not be achieved with any
existing filter or combination of separate existing devices.
Traditional carotid artery stenting uses large pore distal filters to capture embolic particles
released during the procedure that could cause neurological injury, transient ischemic
attack (TIA), stroke, or other adverse events. Embolic risk during a CAS procedure is highest
during the stent deployment and post-dilation phases of the procedure (Kastrup 2003,
Müller-Hülsbeck 2003, Schnaudigel 2008). Traditional filters must maintain minimum pore
sizes of 100 microns to avoid filter thrombosis during prolonged use throughout the carotid
stenting procedure. However, approximately 69-90% of embolic particles released during
carotid artery stenting procedures are less than 100 microns in size, and thus may reach the
cerebral circulation despite the use of these large pore distal filters. Furthermore, small
particles may bypass traditional filters due to malapposition of the filter to the vessel wall or
the inability of the filter’s large pores to capture smaller debris (Langhoc 2019, Langhoc
2022, Petkoska 2024, Henry 2017). This fundamental limitation of large-pore distal filters has
likely contributed to higher historical stroke rates seen with traditional stenting procedures.
The Neuroguard IEP System addresses the critical gap in traditional carotid stenting
procedures through its unique integrated, adjustable 40-micron pore filter that is deployed
selectively and integrally during the highest risk phases of the procedure – stent deployment
and post-dilation – when microemboli generation is at its peak (Kastrup 2003, Müller-
Hülsbeck 2003, Schnaudigel 2008). The Neuroguard IEP System enables placement of the
40-micron pore filter, deployment of the stent, and post-dilation ballooning all through a
single catheter, without need for additional catheter exchanges. This system also features a
dynamically adjustable filter which can be custom sized by the physician to suit individual
patient anatomy, thus eliminating the risk that embolic particles can get around the filter and
reach the brain. No other previous carotid stent system ocers these capabilities, and no
other previous carotid stent system ocers the same level of stroke protection as Neuroguard
IEP.
The targeted approach of the Neuroguard IEP system solves the previously intractable
dilemma of capturing microemboli smaller than 100 microns without compromising patient
safety. The system's innovative 40-micron integrated embolic protection mechanism along
with the integrated delivery platform achieves three unprecedented benefits:
1. Captures emboli less than100 microns, a majority of which would otherwise
typically escape traditional filters, potentially reaching the brain and increasing stroke
risk.
2. Provides adjustable filter sizing to fit each patient's unique vascular anatomy,
avoiding incomplete wall apposition (malapposition) and ensuring comprehensive
protection not feasible with standard fixed designs.
3. Reduces multiple device exchanges which are themselves a cause of microemboli
generation (every catheter exchange increases this risk).
The use of Neuroguard results in unparalleled, targeted embolic protection precisely when
needed the most, along with improved procedural eciciency resulting in unprecedented low
stroke rates, as demonstrated in clinical trials.
Contego Medical submitted an NTAP application for Neuroguard in October 2024. In the
FY2026 IPPS Proposed Rule CMS discusses several key aspects of the NTAP application:
• Whether the Neuroguard IEP® System is substantially similar to existing carotid stent
and embolic protection technologies, in mechanism and therapeutic outcome.
2
• Whether the requirement to use Neuroguard with primary embolic protection devices
suggests the integrated filter does not impact the mechanism of action.
• Whether integrating multiple procedural devices into one system represents a true
innovation or is primarily an ease-of-use improvement.
• The need for contemporary comparative clinical data to demonstrate substantial
clinical improvement over current alternatives, and protocol dicerences.
DETAILED RESPONSE
This letter provides detailed responses to address each of the specific questions raised by
CMS regarding the newness and substantial clinical improvement criteria for the Neuroguard
IEP System, with additional information and clarification. Specifically, we provide detailed
evidence that:
1. The Neuroguard IEP System satisfies the newness criterion because it uses a
fundamentally dicerent mechanism of action through integrated embolic protection
that addresses critical limitations of existing carotid stenting technologies (See
Section 1).
2. The system represents substantial clinical improvement compared to existing
devices through unprecedented stroke reduction, superior outcomes versus
contemporary comparators, and statistically significant improvement over
established benchmarks in high-risk populations (See Section 2).
3. The Neuroguard IEP System satisfies the cost criterion required to be granted NTAP
based on submitted analyses (See Section 3).
We also address CMS' specific questions about mechanism of action, device integration,
comparison to existing technologies including the Paladin system, and the methodology for
comparing outcomes to contemporary versus historical comparators.
Section 1. Newness of the Neuroguard IEP System
In the proposed rule, CMS raised several questions regarding whether the Neuroguard IEP
System meets the newness criterion. We address each specific issue below.
A. CMS Discussion Point: Whether the 40-micron pore filter represents a new
mechanism of action (MOA)
CMS questioned "whether the 40-micron filter represents a new mechanism of action" and
noted that the "filter size is not relevant to the mechanism of action". CMS stated that "both
3
Neuroguard's filter and existing filters use a porous membrane to capture and remove
embolic material while performing angioplasty and stenting procedures in carotid arteries."
Response: We appreciate CMS's thorough review and the opportunity to highlight how the
Neuroguard IEP System's fundamental design dicerences create a distinct MOA. We
respectfully submit that while both systems use porous membranes, the Neuroguard IEP
System's mechanism of action is fundamentally distinct in both design and clinical ecect,
directly addressing a critical limitation that has persisted in carotid stenting for decades.
Why Neuroguard's MOA Is Distinctly New
Limitations of Current Carotid Artery Stenting
• The necessity of embolic protection devices (EPD) during CAS is indisputable and
established practice is routine use of EPD to prevent stroke-causing emboli from
reaching the brain. Use of EPD is emphasized by physician society guidelines, required by
CMS for Medicare coverage of CAS, and supported by clinical evidence – two meta-
analyses demonstrated that EPD use during CAS results in a reduction in both stroke and
death (2016 SCAI/SVM Expert Consensus Statement and 2022 JACC State of the Art
Review; National Coverage Determination (NCD) 20.7. Percutaneous Transluminal
Angioplasty (PTA))
• The first step of a carotid stenting procedure typically involves placing an EPD to capture
embolic material released during the procedure. A traditional embolic protection device
is a separate catheter from both the stent delivery system and the post-dilation balloon
and therefore must be placed in sequential order through a small, percutaneous access
port such as a 6F sheath. As such, the separate EPD must be placed first to maintain the
most distal position and is therefore open for the entire procedure.
• Existing FDA approved EPDs for carotid artery stenting are designed as single, non-
integrated, prolonged-use filters with large-pores between100-280 microns. The reason
these existing filters have a minimum pore size of 100 microns is that the pores must be
large enough to prevent filter thrombosis during extended use. Unfortunately, the
shortcoming of this design allows the majority of microemboli (<100 microns) — which
constitute approximately 69–90% of all particles released during CAS — to pass
uninhibited into the intracranial circulation (Langhoc 2019, Langhoc 2022, Petkoska
2024, Henry 2017). Transcranial Doppler studies have confirmed that despite EPD use,
embolic material consistently reaches the middle cerebral artery and intracranial
circulation. Embolic signals are detected during all phases of the procedure, with the
majority occurring during stent deployment and post-dilation—precisely when the risk of
neurological injury is highest (Kastrup 2003, Müller-Hülsbeck 2003, Schnaudigel 2008).
4
These microemboli are directly linked to new ischemic lesions on dicusion-weighted
MRI, and embolization during these phases can cause adverse neurological outcomes
including stroke, cognitive decline, and memory impairment, even in the absence of
major stroke.
• This fundamental limitation cannot be solved by existing devices or combination of
devices. Crucially, small-pore filters (<100 microns) cannot be used as stand-alone
protection throughout the procedure because their prolonged deployment would
significantly increase the risk of fibrin and platelet build up and lead to filter thrombosis,
resulting in serious complications such as thromboembolic stroke and significant patient
morbidity and mortality, as confirmed in clinical literature and device design guidelines.
This technical and clinical constraint is why no current FDA-cleared distal EPD features a
pore size less than 100 microns.
• Combining two or more existing EPDs, or using them in sequence, does not overcome the
core technical constraint: no traditional filter can simultaneously (a) maintain adequate
flow and cerebral perfusion for the duration of the procedure and (b) capture
microemboli down to 40 microns.
• Furthermore, anatomical mismatches and procedural movement often result in
malapposition of traditional filters to the vessel wall, allowing emboli to bypass the
filter—another reason why particles pass uninhibited to the brain.
• Consequently, the current practice is to use large-pore filters despite their inability to
capture most microembolic debris, which permits these particles to reach the cerebral
circulation—potentially resulting in stroke and cognitive decline for the patient. The
inherent shortcomings of large-pore filters may explain the historically higher stroke rates
seen with previous carotid stent platforms.
Neuroguard's Novel Solution:
The Neuroguard IEP System addresses the critical clinical limitation of previous carotid stent
devices through a fundamentally dicerent and multifaceted mechanism of action that
cannot be replicated by existing technologies. Its innovation is based on several integrated
features that solve the previously intractable dilemma of capturing microemboli without
compromising patient safety. The following mechanistic and system dicerences
demonstrate how this novel approach creates therapeutic capabilities not achievable
through any combination of existing devices.
5
Key Mechanism of Action and System Di‘erences:
1. Smaller Filter Size & Selective Deployment in Tandem with Standard Embolic
Protection O‘ers Dual Protection (see Figure 1):
o Unlike traditional filters, which require larger pores (100–280 microns) to prevent
thrombosis during continuous deployment—thereby allowing 69–90% of particles
less than 100 microns to escape—Neuroguard IEP employs an integrated 40-
micron pore filter that is selectively and precisely deployed only during the
highest-risk phases of the procedure: stent deployment and post-dilation.
o This precisely targeted and temporary deployment enables ultra-fine filtration
exactly when and where it is needed, minimizing exposure and risk of filter
thrombosis—as confirmed by clinical trials such as PERFORMANCE II, which
showed no increase in thrombosis or flow compromise despite the smaller pores.
o Neuroguard does not replace but works in tandem with a standard embolic
protection device, providing a dual protection strategy:
§ The standard embolic protection device ocers protection throughout the
procedure
§ Neuroguard's integrated 40-micron filter provides supplemental, enhanced
protection against emboli during the highest-risk phases of the procedure.
o This dual-protection approach ensures comprehensive embolic protection
throughout the procedure, addressing both large and small particles that
contribute to stroke and cognitive decline.
o No other stent-filter system combines this pore size, procedural eciciency, and
safety data to match Neuroguard's performance.
2. Integration Enables Usage of 40-micron pore Protection and Real-Time Filter Control
Without Catheter Exchanges:
o The 3-in-1 integration of the filter, stent delivery system, and balloon dilation
device on a single catheter facilitates a unique mechanism of action that enables
new therapeutic function – precisely timed 40-micron pore protection, adjustable
filter control, and fewer procedural steps.
o Traditional devices are separate, with only 1 catheter in place at a time, requiring
sequential placement: first the traditional filter in the most distal position, then
the stent delivery catheter, followed by the post-dilation balloon catheter
exchange. The sequential placement of separate non-integrated devices dictates
6
that the traditional filter is open for the entire procedure and thus limits the filter
pore size that can be used.
o The integrated design eliminates 2-3 catheter exchanges which are risky in and of
themselves as they can generate embolic events during device manipulation and
crossing of the lesion (Kim 2010). The integrated design means reduced risk of
emboli release during device manipulation, and seamless protection during stent
deployment—a capability that no existing separate device or combination of
devices can provide.
3. Operator-Adjustable Filter Design Ensures Flawless Coverage:
o A key distinction of the Neuroguard integrated filter is that it is operator-
adjustable: it can be precisely adjusted to fit each patient's unique vascular
anatomy, ensuring optimal wall apposition even in tortuous or curved vessels –
something standard fixed design filters cannot achieve.
o The deployment mechanism provides tactile feedback and dynamic sizing by the
physician that allows for full wall apposition in any type of anatomy, unlike
standard distal filters which expand to a predetermined diameter and are not
adjustable during the procedure.
4. Advanced Stent Design (see Table 1 & Figure 2): Beyond the innovative embolic
protection capabilities, the Neuroguard IEP System's stent design itself contributes to the
overall novel mechanism of action by addressing fundamental challenges in carotid
stenting that have historically limited procedural success and safety outcomes.
• Closed cell design which helps prevent plaque or debris from protruding through
the stent struts and potentially causing embolic events.
• Asymmetrical hourglass configuration which allows the stent to conform more
naturally to the vessel's anatomy improving stability.
• FlexRing design gives a balance of flexibility and radial strength for optimal vessel
scacolding and minimizing vessel injury.
• Purpose-built carotid artery design dicers from traditional stent platforms.
5. Mechanism of Embolic Capture- Direct Capture at the Lesion Site: The Neuroguard
filter is positioned just distal to the lesion and is designed to capture embolic debris
generated during both angioplasty and stenting.
7
In summary, Neuroguard’s design distinctions enable a novel mechanism of action that
directly addresses the root cause of procedure-related embolic events—microemboli
generated during stent deployment and post-dilation, when perioperative stroke risk is
highest. Neuroguard's approach, featuring selective 40-micron pore filtration, integrated
delivery, and operator-adjustable design, overcomes the fundamental limitations of
traditional filters by capturing microemboli during the most critical phases without
compromising safety. This fundamentally alters the treatment paradigm for carotid stenting,
creating therapeutic capabilities and clinical outcomes—such as significant stroke risk
reduction—not achievable with any existing device or combination of technologies. As such,
the Neuroguard IEP System clearly meets the newness criterion, representing a distinct and
innovative mechanism of action rather than an incremental improvement.
CMS has previously recognized this principle in evaluating drug eluting stents, where
innovative delivery mechanisms—such as adding a polymer—created a novel therapeutic
approach even when using the same drug (paclitaxel) as previous drug eluting stents.
Similarly, the addition of a separate, integrated 40-micron filter creates a dual protection
system and mechanism of action that distinguishes Neuroguard from all existing single-filter
carotid technologies, which lack this capability.
B. CMS Discussion Point: Use with Primary Embolic Protection
CMS questioned whether the requirement that Neuroguard IEP must always be used in
conjunction with an available primary distal embolic protection device "suggests that its
filter would not impact the mechanism of action of the device."
Response: The requirement to use the Neuroguard IEP System in conjunction with a primary
distal embolic protection device does not diminish its novel mechanism of action but rather
underscores its innovative complementary approach to solving a critical clinical limitation in
carotid stenting procedures, as outlined below:
1. Complementary, Not Redundant Protection: As described in the mechanism of action
analysis above, the Neuroguard system provides dual embolic protection where:
• A primary standard filter provides protection against large emboli (>100 microns)
throughout the procedure, and
• Neuroguard's integrated 40-micron pore filter provides added protection to
capture the microemboli standard filters can’t during the highest-risk phases of
the procedure.
2. Addressing a Critical Protection Gap: The complementary use of the 40-micron pore
filter reflects the technical reality that no single filter can simultaneously maintain
8
adequate flow throughout a prolonged procedure to avoid filter thrombosis AND capture
microemboli down to 40 microns. Neuroguard's innovation—through its selective
activation and integrated design—solves this previously intractable dilemma. The
complementary requirement validates rather than undermines the novel MOA —it
demonstrates this is an entirely new category of protection that supplements rather than
replaces existing approaches. This creates a new therapeutic paradigm similar to
combination therapies that achieve superior outcomes through complementary
mechanisms. No existing carotid technology provides dual embolic protection with
selective small-pore filtration, establishing Neuroguard as categorically distinct from
single-mechanism non-integrated devices.
3. Clinical Outcomes Reflecting Distinct Function: The clinical evidence supports this
mechanistic distinction: The PERFORMANCE I and II trials demonstrated zero major
strokes, zero neurologic deaths, and zero stent thromboses (Gray 2025, Langhoc 2022) —
outcomes that cannot be explained by simply combining existing technologies,
suggesting a fundamentally dicerent protection mechanism.
By ocering complementary, not redundant protection, the Neuroguard IEP System addresses
a critical protection gap through an innovative solution to a technical constraint, with clinical
outcomes reflecting its distinct function. Far from diminishing its mechanism of action, this
complementary relationship highlights Neuroguard's innovative solution to a previously
unsolvable technical problem: how to capture smaller microemboli without adding
thrombosis risk. The complementary use with primary filters underscores the Neuroguard
IEP System's innovative approach to solving a previously unaddressed clinical need within
the carotid stenting procedure. This unique MOA is not possible with other commercially
available technologies, including first-generation embolic protection devices like
Emboshield Nav 6TM (Abbott Cardiovascular), FILTERWIRE EZTM (Boston Scientific, Inc),
SpiderFXTM (Medtronic, Inc.), ANGIOGUARDTM (Cordis, Inc.) and Paladin (Contego Medical,
Inc) nor with FDA approved dual layer stents including Gore® Carotid Stent (W.L. Gore &
Associates) and ROADSTER (Terumo), which require separate deployment steps and cannot
maintain small-pore protection during stent deployment and post-dilation. The Neuroguard®
IEP system works to provide a novel 40-micron level of protection that fundamentally
changes the risk profile of the procedure.
C. CMS Discussion Point: Comparison to other devices, such as the Paladin Carotid
Post-Dilation Balloon System
CMS questioned if the Neuroguard IEP System met the newness criterion if "there are other
existing embolic protection filters used during CAS procedures that have the same 40-micron
pore size, such as the Paladin Carotid Post-Dilation Balloon System with Integrated Embolic
9
Protection (Paladin System with IEP) from the same manufacturer, which received FDA
510(k) clearance on September 6, 2018."
Response: As detailed in our mechanism of action analysis above, the Neuroguard IEP
System fundamentally dicers from Paladin in mechanism of action and clinical utility,
despite both featuring a 40-micron pore filter. The key dicerences relate to procedural
coverage and device integration, both of which are substantial dicerences and critical to
understanding why Neuroguard represents a novel therapeutic approach:
1. Critical Procedural Coverage Di‘erences
• The Paladin balloon is a separate balloon catheter with integrated embolic
protection (but without a stent), that can provide small-pore coverage only during
balloon dilation before or after a traditional carotid stent placement. However, it
cannot be used with a stent during stent deployment, leaving patients
unprotected during the high-risk stent deployment phase of the procedure.
Several studies have shown that embolic is risk is equally high during the stenting
and post-dilation phases of the carotid stenting procedure (Kastrup 2003, Müller-
Hülsbeck 2003, Schnaudigel 2008). It is thus necessary to protect against micro-
embolic during both phases.
• In contrast, Neuroguard’s integrated design provides 40-micron pore protection
during both the stent deployment and post-dilation phases.
2. Di‘erent Device Integration & Impact
• The Paladin balloon must be used with separate stenting systems, which requires
additional catheter exchanges and therefore increased embolic risk.
• The Neuroguard IEP System consists of a stent, balloon, and filter on a single
platform, eliminating exchanges which increase the risk of microemboli and
providing comprehensive protection.
3. Distinct Regulatory Scope and Limited Market Adoption
• Paladin's 510(k) clearance (2018/2022) was limited to balloon angioplasty and
post-dilation of a deployed self-expanding stent. Furthermore, the Paladin balloon
was not widely commercialized in the United States. Company records show no
sales in 2021, 28 units in 2022, 139 in 2023, and 200 in 2024, representing only a
minimal fraction of all carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures.
• In comparison, Neuroguard received FDA PMA (2024) as a novel device with no
predicate. This comprehensive integrated solution not only enhances protection
10
but also improves procedural eciciency, as validated by the more rigorous PMA
process.
In summary, the Neuroguard IEP System demonstrates meaningful dicerentiation from the
Paladin system in both fundamental design and clinical application. Importantly, as a
separate catheter, Paladin cannot provide embolic protection during the stenting phase
itself, one of the riskiest periods for embolization, since it must be removed before stent
deployment. Given its limited adoption and lack of integrated embolic protection during all
highest-risk procedural phases, the Paladin device is not capable of, nor does it provide, the
comprehensive, innovative mechanism of action and embolic protection of the Neuroguard
IEP System.
D. CMS Discussion Point: Device integration and Mechanism of Action
CMS questioned "how integrating existing procedural devices into one device to eliminate
the need for multiple devices results in a diQerent mechanism of action, as this appears to
describe an ease-of-use feature rather than having an impact on the technology's
therapeutic outcome of improving carotid luminal diameter for patients with stenosis of the
carotid artery. It is unclear how the way in which the Neuroguard IEP® System treats carotid
artery stenosis is diQerent from the way in which the many existing carotid artery stents,
filters, and post-dilation balloons available on the market, used together or as part of a
system, treat carotid artery stenosis."
Response: We appreciate CMS's careful consideration and the opportunity to clarify that the
Neuroguard IEP System's integrated design is not merely an "ease-of-use" feature, but rather
a fundamental innovation that creates a new therapeutic mechanism of action—one that
cannot be replicated by using existing stents, filters, and balloons in combination.
Key Points of Distinction
1. Integration Is Fundamental to a New MOA. The Neuroguard IEP System is the first and
only device to integrate a stent, post-dilation balloon, and an ultra-fine 40-micron pore
filter onto a single catheter. This is not just procedural streamlining; it fundamentally
changes how carotid artery stenosis is treated by enabling:
• 40-micron Pore Integrated Embolic Protection
The integrated system provides targeted 40-micron pore filter technology
protection during critical stent deployment and post-dilation phases. No other
system—alone or in combination—can provide this level of protection. Separate
devices introduce protection gaps due to their large pore filter size, filter
malapposition and the need for catheter exchanges.
11
• Direct, Precise Lesion Treatment: The integrated filter is positioned just distal to
the lesion, capturing debris at the source, during all critical steps—angioplasty
and stenting. The operator-adjustable filter ensures optimal apposition for every
patient's anatomy, maximizing embolic capture and minimizing risk.
2. Why This Cannot Be Achieved with Existing Devices
Protection Gaps Are Inherent to Separate Devices:
• Traditional workflows require multiple device exchanges (filter, stent, balloon),
each creating periods of suboptimal embolic protection precisely when embolic
risk is highest.
• Small-pore filters (e.g., 40-microns) cannot be used as stand-alone protection due
to filter thrombosis and flow compromise risk if deployed for the entire procedure.
The only way to use a 40-micron small pore filter is by minimizing the time it is
deployed in vivo such that it is only open during stenting and post-dilation, and
this is only possible with an integrated system.
• No combination of existing stents, filters, and balloons can eliminate these
protection gaps or provide seamless, phase-specific 40-micron pore protection.
Mechanistic and Clinical Superiority Is Integration-Dependent:
• The ability to capture more microembolic particles at the time and site of highest
risk is only possible because of the integrated, operator-adjustable design.
• Capture and protection of this level is not achievable by using existing devices,
even in combination, because they lack the necessary timing, positioning, and
anatomical adaptability.
3. Optimized Technology Impacts Clinical Outcomes. The advanced stent design
(closed-cell, FlexRing, hourglass configuration, flared ends) is purpose-built for the
carotid artery, ensuring optimal vessel scacolding, minimizing plaque protrusion, and
maintaining luminal diameter. The integrated post-dilation balloon allows precise,
immediate optimization of stent expansion, reducing the risk of recoil or residual stenosis
or restenosis. By reducing embolic risk during high-risk steps, the Neuroguard IEP System
ensures that luminal gain is achieved without the trade-oc of increased stroke risk that
can occur with traditional systems.
Superior Clinical Outcomes: The Neuroguard IEP System's integrated approach has
resulted in the lowest stroke rates compared to traditional carotid stents. The
PERFORMANCE II study demonstrated zero major strokes, zero neurologic deaths, and zero
12
stent thromboses at both 30 days and 1 year—results not observed with traditional, non-
integrated device combinations. This is not merely procedural convenience; it is a
therapeutic advance that addresses the root cause of procedure-related strokes: inadequate
embolic protection during the riskiest phases.
Figure 1: This picture depicts a carotid artery during stent deployment and post-dilation,
comparing traditional stenting vs Neuroguard IEP, showing how Neuroguard's integrated 40-
micron pore filter acts like a safety net positioned downstream, capturing the shower of tiny
embolic particles (illustrated as small dots) that are released during these critical procedural
steps (right hand side panel of two pictures showing stenting and post dilation phases),
demonstrating how the integrated protection works precisely when embolic risk is highest-
during stenting and post-dilation. Traditional larger-pore filters are shown allowing these
same particles to pass through like sand through a wide mesh (left hand side panel of 3
pictures showing stenting, post dilation with traditional balloon and alternatively post
dilation with Paladin); Paladin ocers 40-micron protection during post-dilation, but not
stenting and requires another catheter exchange as compared to Neuroguard IEP.

Figure 2. Neuroguard's mechanism of action is distinguished by its integrated, continuous,
as well as targeted finer-pore embolic protection, streamlined workflow, and advanced stent
design, all of which aim to improve both safety and ecicacy compared to traditional multi-
device carotid stenting systems.
In summary, Integration is not merely an "ease-of-use" feature. Neuroguard's integration is
the fundamental enabler of a new mechanism of action: integrated, targeted 40-micron pore
embolic protection, advanced stent deployment, and direct clinical impact on both luminal
diameter and stroke risk. These outcomes cannot be achieved by any combination of existing
carotid stents, filters, and balloons. The convenience is not cosmetic—it is critical to the
mechanism which is not an incremental improvement, but a paradigm shift in carotid
stenting.
14
CMS Recognition of Device Innovations that Transform Function
We appreciate CMS's thoughtful and rigorous approach to evaluating new medical
technologies, including its recognition of nuanced distinctions in device design and clinical
function. CMS has a history of acknowledging when design innovations create meaningful
functional dicerences—even when devices share basic structural similarities.
For example, in evaluating the Eluvia™ Drug Eluting Stent, CMS recognized that although the
device used paclitaxel like other peripheral drug-eluting stents, its distinctive long-term drug
release profile due to the addition of a polymer constituted a unique MOA (FY2021 Medicare
Final Inpatient Rule CMS-1735-F, 9/18/2020).
CMS recognized that integrating a novel distinction to existing technology to address a
critical treatment limitation—such as sustained drug delivery—constituted a novel
mechanism of action. Similarly, the Neuroguard IEP System integrates a critical function that
fundamentally alters treatment for carotid stenting. Just as the addition of a polymer matrix
addressed the duration limitation of previous drug-eluting technologies, Neuroguard
uniquely addresses the lack of micro-embolic protection during stent deployment and post-
dilation—protection gaps that cannot be addressed by any combination of separate existing
devices.
Embolic protection during stent expansion is not merely a convenience, but a fundamental
shift in how protection is delivered at the highest-risk moments of the procedure. Therefore,
consistent with CMS's prior decisions recognizing technologies that overcome key
limitations of existing therapies, we believe Neuroguard should be recognized as having a
novel mechanism of action, meeting the newness criterion and warranting NTAP approval.
Section 2. Substantial Clinical Improvement of the Neuroguard IEP System
In the proposed rule, CMS stated the following concerns with regard to the substantial
clinical improvement compared to existing CAS technologies.
A. CMS Concern: Comparison to Contemporary Comparators
CMS noted that it did not "receive information comparing the Neuroguard IEP® System with
other currently available treatments developed more recently, such as GORE Carotid Stent,
Sterling SL Balloon Dilatation Catheters, or Paladin System…".
Response: The Neuroguard IEP System demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in the
PERFORMANCE I and II trials compared to both historical and contemporary carotid artery
stents. In PERFORMANCE I, the system achieved a 0% stroke/death rate at 30 days in 67
15
high-risk patients, with no target lesion revascularization or in-stent restenosis at 12 months
(Langhoc 2022). PERFORMANCE II expanded these findings in 305 patients, demonstrating a
1.3% 30-day rate of stroke rate, all minor strokes and none of which were major strokes, and
only one additional minor ipsilateral stroke (0.37%) at one year (Gray 2025). The data
submitted to the CMS as part of the NTAP application (refer to Appendix 2) pertains to
commercially available medical devices in the United States, with comparable symptomatic
and asymptomatic patient populations. Additionally, we have included a second table
containing further data as requested by CMS (refer to Appendix 3). Findings for the specific
devices requested by CMS are summarized below:
• GORE Carotid Stent: To date, this stent has not been made commercially available in
the United States. Two clinical papers outline its results. The 2018 Schneider, et al.,
study did not include the full data set (includes on the per-protocol dataset, not the
intention-to-treat dataset), although it is included in the table below. We believe a
more relevant comparator is the data included in the 2022 Mazurek, et al., meta-
analysis which includes the full data set for the GORE Carotid Stent and reports a 30-
day stroke rate of 2.89%, with 1.6% being major and 1.3% minor strokes. This is
substantially higher than the 30-day stroke rate of 1.3%, all minor strokes, for the
Neuroguard IEP System.
• Sterling SL Balloon: No comparable peer-reviewed clinical outcomes data were
identified.
• Paladin System: As described above, Paladin is not a carotid artery stent but a
separate angioplasty balloon with a small pore filter. It requires the use of a stand-
alone stent. Therefore, we do not believe Paladin should be considered a comparator
but rather a step towards the Neuroguard IEP System, as discussed earlier. The
published data reports a 30-day stroke rate of 1%; however, this was not powered to
study a carotid artery stent system.
The Mazurek meta-analysis, summarized in Appendix 3, highlights improved outcomes
associated with second-generation stents as compared to their first-generation
counterparts. However, it is important to note that this analysis incorporated non-FDA-
approved platforms, such as the CGuardTM (InspireMD), the data for which has been
collected solely outside the US to date. Data from the clinical trial conducted in the US has
not undergone FDA-level review at this time. In contrast, the results from the Neuroguard
PERFORMANCE trial provide compelling evidence of a statistically significant reduction in
stroke rates, demonstrating superior ecicacy over historical first-generation carotid artery
stenting systems, while also ocering advantages as compared to current contemporary
alternatives.

B. CMS Concern: Protocol Di‘erences Between Historical and Contemporary Trials
CMS noted "that the pre- and post-treatment protocols for the PERFORMANCE II trial were
more comprehensive compared to those of the SAPPHIRE trial and that this may reflect
changes in standards of care over the past two decades. For example, we note that the
patients in the PERFORMANCE II had been given clopidogrel 75 mg (or equivalent) and
aspirin 75 mg daily for one week before surgery, and dual antiplatelet therapy was required
for at least 30 days after the procedure (and thereafter, at the physician's discretion and
standard of care), whereas the patients in the SAPPHIRE trial were given an aspirin at a dose
of 81 or 325 mg per day for at least 72 hours before the procedure and indefinitely after the
procedure, and with clopidogrel 75 mg per day starting 24 hours before the procedure and
continuing for two to four weeks after the procedure. We question whether the observed
lower stroke rate was at least partly the result of a more advanced and comprehensive
treatment protocol."
Response: The SAPPHIRE trial (Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High
Risk for Endarterectomy) was a landmark trial that compared carotid artery stenting (CAS)
with embolic protection to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in high-risk patients. This trial was
conducted in the early 2000s and used a dual antiplatelet therapy strategy for CAS in
accordance with best practice at the time, guided by emerging clinical evidence.
Dual antiplatelet therapy DAPT is a key component of periprocedural management in CAS.
The lower rate of stroke in the PERFORMANCE II trial is not primarily attributable to
dicerences in DAPT regimens.
Other clinical trials, such as the SCAFFOLD trial, have used DAPT protocols similar to
PERFORMANCE I and II but have not achieved similar clinical outcomes (NCT01901874).
DAPT strategies utilized in current day CAS may involve more standardized loading doses or
extended pre-procedural intervals as provided in ACC/AHA/SCAI clinical practice guidelines,
however this alone is insucicient to account for the reduction in stroke rates in
PERFORMANCE II trial. It is highly unlikely, based on the mechanism and onset of action of
both clopidogrel and aspirin, that the dicering antiplatelet regimen, across studies and over
time, would contribute to the lower stroke rate found in PERFORMANCE II. Platelet
aggregation is significantly reduced within 60 minutes of taking aspirin. Aspirin's ecect on
platelets is essentially for the lifespan of the acected platelet, which is 10 days. The
exposure to aspirin in both treatment regimens should have achieved the same level of
platelet inhibition. In regard to clopidogrel, it may take 3 to 7 days to reach the full
antiplatelet ecect. Patients in the SAPPHIRE trial were administered clopidogrel for 2 to 4
weeks after carotid stenting and at least 30 days in PERFORMANCE II. Given the size of the
17
carotid artery, the arterial flow through the stent, and the low vascular resistance of the brain
circulation, stent thrombosis in non-mesh covered stents is an exceedingly rare occurrence.
C. CMS Concerns: Historical comparators
CMS inquired "whether growth in CAS volume, a multitude of commercially available FDA-
approved carotid stents, changes in standard of care, and trends in the prevalence of
diabetes and hypertension in the U.S. population during the last two decades were
considered in the interpretation of the findings of the two PERFORMANCE trials."
Response: There is no doubt that the growth in CAS volume over the past two decades has
acorded physicians more experience and honing of clinical judgement, which should both
positively acect CAS outcomes in general. Likewise, advances in the optimal medical
therapy for patients with carotid artery disease should also positively acect CAS outcomes.
Both diabetes and hypertension have proliferated in the US population over the past two
decades, and the prevalence of diabetes in the PERFORMANCE II trial population was one of
the highest ever reported at 43%. As diabetes is usually associated with worse outcomes in
patients with carotid artery disease, the low event rates in PERFORMANCE II are likely driven
by the enhanced safety acorded by the 40-micron filter and purpose-built nitinol carotid
stent – and the results of this trial are perhaps even more notable given the higher
percentage of people with diabetes in the study sample.
D. CMS Concerns: Historical controls
CMS raised concerns about trial design heterogeneity and population variability when
comparing Neuroguard IEP System outcomes to historical controls. CMS expressed concern
that dicerences in study design, patient populations, and outcome definitions across the
referenced clinical trials may limit the validity of direct comparisons to the Neuroguard IEP
System. Specifically, CMS noted variability in trial methodologies (randomized vs. single-
arm, dicering follow-up periods), inclusion criteria (such as degree of stenosis and age
thresholds), and baseline comorbidities (notably higher rates of diabetes and hypertension
in PERFORMANCE II). CMS requested clarification on how these dicerences were addressed
in the development of the weighted objective performance criteria, how comparative studies
were selected, and whether appropriate adjustments were made to ensure that observed
outcome dicerences could be attributed to the device rather than to underlying population or
protocol disparities.
Response: PERFORMANCE II was a single-arm study consistent with PMA IDE methodology,
and outcomes were benchmarked against a comprehensive set of historical controls. The
PERFORMANCE II trial design was usual and customary for a PMA clinical trial. With this goal
in mind, the patient population was, by design, the most challenging, including surgical high-
18
risk patients who could be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. The primary focus was on
30-day and 1-year outcomes for death and stroke, both major and minor, aligning with other
high-risk carotid stenting studies. Outcome timelines were typical, with a primary endpoint
at 30 days (death, stroke, and myocardial infarction) and the assessment of ipsilateral stroke
within 12 months. A key inclusion criterion was patients at high risk for carotid
endarterectomy (CEA), with enrollment rates matching those of comparator trials. All
compared trials included similar high-risk populations and measured the same key
outcomes, which supports attributing observed dicerences in results to the device itself.
While myocardial infarction was part of the primary endpoint, it was also included as part of
the primary endpoint in the majority of other PMA IDE carotid stenting trials. Notably, the
proportion of symptomatic patients in PERFORMANCE II was 20%, mirroring the mix in other
studies and confirming population comparability. The PERFORMANCE II trial population
represented the highest-risk demographic when compared to the ARCHER, SECURITY,
BEACH, and SCAFFOLD trials. Nevertheless, our results demonstrated superiority over these
studies, which can be attributed to advancements in technology, specifically with the
Neuroguard IEP System.
1. Clinical outcome comparison:
CMS had specific questions regarding whether dicerences from historical comparators
were statistically significant and clinically meaningful, and how statistical significance was
determined. CMS inquired about the weighted Z-test for the primary endpoint and how it may
fully account for variability in patient comorbidities or procedural dicerences and enhance
generalizability.
Response: We appreciate CMS's detailed review and the opportunity to clarify the statistical
and clinical interpretation of the results from the PERFORMANCE II study. The following
response addresses CMS's inquiry regarding whether the observed dicerences in clinical
outcomes between the Neuroguard IEP® System and historical comparator trials are
statistically significant, clinically meaningful, and supported by a robust analytic approach
that accounts for patient variability and enhances generalizability.
The primary endpoint of the PERFORMANCE II study was a composite of all-cause death,
stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) within 30 days of the index procedure, plus ipsilateral
stroke between day 31 and 12 months. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the
observed event rate was 2.84%. This was compared against a pre-specified performance
goal (PG) of 13.8%, derived from weighted Objective Performance Criteria (OPC) based on
outcomes in prior FDA-reviewed IDE studies (ARCHeR, BEACH, SECuRITY, and SCAFFOLD).
The Z-score for the primary endpoint, calculated using actual proportions of comorbid
(74.5%) and anatomic (25.5%) high-risk patients and their corresponding PG rates (15% and
19
11%, respectively), was 5.316 in the ITT population. This Z-score exceeds the pre-defined
one-sided threshold of Z > 1.645, demonstrating that the Neuroguard IEP System achieved a
statistically significant improvement over the PG, with a p-value < 0.00001 (Gray 2025). A
similar result was confirmed in the per-protocol (PP) population with a Z-score of 5.474.
These analyses were prespecified and executed according to the Statistical Analysis Plan.
Regarding the clinical relevance of outcome dicerences, particularly in comparison to the
SCAFFOLD trial, which reported a 30-day stroke rate of 1.1%, it is important to clarify that the
rate of stroke at 30 days in the SCAFFOLD study was reported only for the per-protocol (PP)
population, which excluded patients with protocol deviations. The 2022 Mazurek et al.,
meta-analysis reports a 30-day stroke rate for the GORE Carotid Stent of 2.89%, with 1.6%
major stroke and 1.3% minor strokes. In contrast, the 1.31% 30-day stroke rate observed in
PERFORMANCE II was derived from the ITT population (all enrolled patients regardless of
treatment received and protocol deviations) and is therefore more conservatively
representative of real-world performance. More notably, the 12-month composite primary
endpoint rate in SCAFFOLD, as described in the FDA Summary of Safety and Ecectiveness
Data (SSED for PMA P180010), was 4.5% in the PP population. This compares to a lower
2.84% in the PERFORMANCE II ITT population, underscoring the clinical meaningfulness of
the observed dicerences despite dicerences in population inclusivity. Importantly, the rate of
stroke at 30 days or the composite endpoint in the SCAFFOLD ITT population is unpublished.
Statistical significance was assessed using a weighted Z-test methodology specifically
designed to reflect real-world clinical variability. The test incorporated event rates in
comorbid and anatomic high-risk groups and weighted them according to their actual
prevalence in the enrolled population. The performance goal (PG) of 13.8% was calculated
using PGs of 15% for comorbid and 11% for anatomic risk patients. Variance terms in the Z-
test calculation were weighted accordingly, as detailed in the SAP which was approved by
FDA. This approach ensured that the test was not only statistically valid but also clinically
relevant, as it directly accounted for heterogeneity in baseline risk and procedural
complexity.
To further support generalizability, the study included 305 subjects from 32 sites across the
United States and Europe. The primary endpoint was analyzed in the ITT population, and
serious adverse events were adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee.
Subgroup analyses, as prespecified in the Statistical Analysis Plan, were conducted across
key demographic and clinical variables, including age, sex, symptomatic status, geographic
region, and carotid endarterectomy risk classification. These analyses showed consistent
outcomes across all subgroups. In addition, poolability analyses by study site and gender
20
found no significant heterogeneity, supporting the overall interpretability and external validity
of the study findings.
In summary, the Neuroguard IEP System demonstrated both statistically significant and
clinically meaningful improvements in stroke and composite adverse event rates compared
to the historical performance goal and to published outcomes from other FDA-approved
carotid stenting systems. The prespecified weighted Z-test used in the analysis incorporated
adjustments for patient comorbidities and procedural variability, ensuring that the findings
are both statistically rigorous and broadly applicable to the Medicare population.
Section 3. Neuroguard IEP System meets the cost criterion
CMS noted that indirect charges were not added to the new technology nor subtracted from
the existing technology.
Response: In the NTAP application, two cost analyses were performed. In both analyses, the
threshold was exceeded. CMS inquired about indirect charges. Indirect charges did not
change from the existing technology to the new technology and, therefore, were not included
in the calculations. We acirm our initial, submitted analysis that the Neuroguard IEP System
meets the cost criterion.
Section 4. The Economics of Stroke: Neuroguard IEP's Potential for Health System
Savings.
Stroke remains one of the most serious and costly complications following carotid
revascularization. Contemporary meta-analyses show that while both carotid
endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) are ecective, stroke risk remains a
major driver of long-term outcomes and health care costs.
Recent evidence on carotid intervention economics comes from the Akkara et al. systematic
review and meta-analysis of the cost ecectiveness of CEA vs CAS (Translational Stroke
Research, 2025). This comprehensive analysis of over 6,400 patients evaluated the cost-
ecectiveness of CEA versus CAS. Although this review did not specifically assess
Neuroguard IEP, it demonstrated that even small dicerences in stroke rates between
procedures can have a meaningful impact on overall cost-ecectiveness, despite similar
initial procedure and one-year costs
First Year Post-Stroke Costs
21
The most recent U.S. estimate for total first-year post-stroke cost – including hospitalization,
rehabilitation, outpatient care and related medical expenses – is $59,900 per patient
(Strilciuc S, et al., 2021) and highlights the potential economic impact of reducing stroke
incidence, underscoring that even a modest reduction in stroke incidence can translate into
significant cost savings for Medicare.
The Akkara et. al., meta analysis indicates that compares to CEA, conventional CAS is
associated with:
• Higher stroke risk than CEA (3.65% vs 2.12%)
• Similar base costs to CEA ($17,711 vs $18,156)
• Shorter procedure time (77.5 vs 191.9 minutes)
• Shorter hospital stays (2.60 vs 3.13 days)
Potential Economic Implications of Neuroguard
By comparing strokes rates from the Neuroguard IEP studies which demonstrated a 30-day
stroke rate of 0-1.3%, to the traditional CAS stroke rate of 3.65%, we can estimate the
following economic implications:
• If 100 Medicare beneficiaries were treated with a device achieving Neuroguard IEP's
reported stroke rates rather than traditional CAS devices, approximately 2–3 fewer
strokes would be expected.
• First-year cost avoidance: 2–3 avoided strokes × $59,900 (average first-year cost) =
$119,800–$179,700 per 100 patients
A reduction in stroke rates may also improve quality-adjusted life years, a critical
component of cost-ecectiveness calculation
Potential Cost Considerations for Medicare
If the reduction in stroke rates observed in Neuroguard IEP studies is realized in clinical
practice, Medicare could see cost savings related to acute hospitalization, post-acute
rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility stays, and outpatient therapy services—areas that
represent substantial expenditures when stroke complications occur after carotid
procedures.
22
Summary
While direct economic analyses of Neuroguard IEP are not yet available, the clinical
outcomes observed in studies suggest potential benefits. Using recent cost data and clinical
results, it is reasonable to anticipate that lower periprocedural stroke rates could have a
positive economic impact for Medicare and the broader health system. Continued real-world
data collection will help further clarify the value proposition of Neuroguard IEP in this
context.
Conclusion
In summary, we maintain our view that the Neuroguard IEP System satisfies the criteria for
NTAP designation regarding newness, cost, and substantial clinical improvement, as
detailed in the following points:
• Meets the newness criterion – Traditional large pore EPDs using 100–280 micron filters
must remain open throughout the procedure to avoid filter thrombosis, inherently
allowing particles <100 microns to pass through. The Neuroguard IEP System introduces
a novel mechanism of action through its use of a dynamically adjustable integrated 40-
micron filter, which is deployed only during the high-risk phases of stent deployment and
post-dilation, thereby avoiding prolonged flow restriction that could lead to filter
thrombosis if used continuously. The system's ability to capture microemboli that would
otherwise reach the brain addresses a longstanding unmet need in carotid artery
stenting. The integration also reduces catheter exchanges, which themselves introduce
increased risk of microemboli. This capability, along with a unique stent design, directly
contributes to the system's superior clinical outcomes and represents a fundamentally
dicerent, novel mechanism of action not possible with separate catheters, and not
available in any other carotid stenting platforms commercially available today.
• Meets the substantial clinical improvement criterion - The Neuroguard IEP System
demonstrates substantial clinical improvement through unprecedented reductions in
procedural and long-term stroke risk, as evidenced by PERFORMANCE I and II trial data
showing 0% major strokes at 30 days and 1.3% minor stroke rate at 30 days-outcomes
superior to both historical and contemporary carotid stenting systems. These results
persisted in high-risk populations with higher rates of diabetes (43%) and hypertension
(93%) compared to earlier trials, underscoring the system's ability to address
microembolic risks during critical procedural phases. While CMS raised concerns about
historical control comparisons, PERFORMANCE II's outcomes remained statistically
23
significant and clinically meaningful when benchmarked against weighted objective
performance criteria accounting for anatomic/comorbid risks. The novel design that
uniquely combines a carotid stent, post-dilation balloon, and 40-micron pore integrated
embolic filter in one device, eliminating the need for multiple catheter exchanges, directly
translates to reduced risk of cerebral microemboli, establishing a new standard for
embolic protection and fulfilling the substantial clinical improvement criterion. Protocol
enhancements (e.g., extended antiplatelet regimens) could not fully account for these
outcomes.
• Meets the cost criterion – Two cost analyses were provided to CMS. In both analyses,
the cost threshold was exceeded. Indirect charges did not change from the existing
technology to the new technology and therefore were not included in the calculations.
We acirm that the Neuroguard IEP System meets the cost criteria.
Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to continued collaboration with
CMS to ensure Medicare beneficiaries have access to innovative therapies. If you have any
questions on these comments, please contact me.

Appendix 4: Supporting Data from the meta-analysis (Akkara et al., Translational Stroke
Research, 2025)
● 30-day stroke rates:
● CEA: 2.12% (mean; range 1.07–6.26%)
● CAS (traditional): 3.65% (mean; range 2.4–4.1%)
● Base procedure cost:
● CEA: $18,157
● CAS: $17,711
● 1-year total cost:
● CEA: $21,264
● CAS: $21,433
● Cost of a single peri-procedural stroke:
● $24,541 (mean acute care cost, 2024 USD)
From the meta-analysis, conventional CAS showed:
● Higher stroke risk than CEA (3.65% vs 2.12%)
● Similar base costs to CEA ($17,711 vs $18,156)
● Shorter procedure time (77.5 vs 191.9 minutes)
● Shorter hospital stays (2.60 vs 3.13 days)
Neuroguard IEP could improve CAS cost-ecectiveness through:
● Reduced stroke complications: The meta-analysis shows strokes are a major cost
driver. By reducing stroke rates from 3.65% (conventional CAS) to approximately 1%
(Neuroguard IEP), significant complication-related costs would be eliminated1.
● Fewer secondary interventions: Lower ischemic lesion volumes and incidence
suggest fewer neurological sequelae requiring additional treatments or
rehabilitation2.
● Improved QALY outcomes: With significantly reduced stroke rates, patients would
likely experience better quality-adjusted life years, a critical component of cost-
ecectiveness calculations.
