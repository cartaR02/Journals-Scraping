RE: (CMS-1835-P) Medicare Program; FY 2026 Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update
and Hospice Quality Reporting Program Requirements
Dear Administrator Oz:
The American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on
the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 Hospice Proposed Update (Proposed Update). ATRA is the largest
professional association representing recreational therapy practitioners. Recreational therapists are
nationally certified and, where applicable, state-licensed to provide activity-based treatment services for
individuals with a range of disabling conditions across the lifespan. Recreational therapists work with
older adults and people with chronic conditions in hospice facilities and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs)
who are receiving hospice throughout the U.S.
RFI on Future Quality Measure Concepts for the Hospice QRP
ATRA strongly supports the creation and focus on well-being as a quality measure in hospice
settings. Well-being is an important issue to be considered and addressed at the end of life.1 Absence of
pain, living in comfort, respected wishes, and family/support1 are issues that contribute to promoting
well-being at the end of life. Addressing physical comfort, mental and emotional needs, spiritual needs,
and practical care are the four areas the Institute on Aging notes as the four areas for care to promote
well-being.2 Ensuring people receiving hospice services have dignity and autonomy, quality of life, and
compassionate, ethical care should be of utmost importance and the focus of a future hospice quality
measure.
We encourage CMS as new measures are crafted to be inclusive of a variety of modalities,
interventions (including non-pharmacological approaches), and practitioners providing services to
individuals receiving hospice. Research demonstrates the value and importance of interprofessional
collaboration in palliative care, particularly with individuals who have dementia3. CMS should ensure that
qualified providers are covered for services to people receiving hospice benefits. This includes Certified
Therapeutic Recreation Specialists (CTRS) who are the qualified providers of recreational therapy
services.

Recreational therapists provide multiple interventions that can benefit people receiving hospice. Non-
pharmacological pain interventions like relaxation3 or physical activity4, sensory stimulation5,
reengagement in leisure interests and passions5, and self-expression and care2,5,6 contribute to well-being
and quality of life, helping people at the end of life to find value, joy, meaning, engagement, and quality
in their lives7. Recreational therapists provide these interventions, promoting a holistic approach that is
individualized and person-centered. Recreational therapy offers people an opportunity to engage and
interact with others, providing support and reducing isolation.5 Interventions can reduce symptoms of
depression, improve mood, decrease anxiety, and promote positive coping skills.5,8
