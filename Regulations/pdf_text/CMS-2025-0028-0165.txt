To Whom It May Concern,
As a thoracic surgeon with Methodist Physicians in San Antonio, I routinely care for patients whose
underlying cardiac conditions are complicated by atrial fibrillation (AF). Across its clinical spectrum,
from early diagnosis to chronic, long-standing disease, AF poses significant implications for
operative planning, surgical risk, and long-term patient outcomes. It is important to emphasize that
long-standing persistent and permanent AF should not be viewed as merely an advanced stage of
paroxysmal AF, but rather as a fundamentally different clinical entity requiring a higher level of care
and resources.
Newly Diagnosed Atrial Fibrillation
In patients with newly diagnosed AF, most commonly paroxysmal or early persistent, atrial
structure and function are often relatively preserved. These patients tend to respond well to early
rhythm-control strategies, including catheter-based or surgical intervention. When surgery is
indicated for other cardiac conditions, such as valve repair or coronary artery bypass grafting,
adjunct procedures like surgical ablation or left atrial appendage exclusion can be performed with
minimal added risk. These patients typically experience fewer complications, have more predictable
recoveries, and require less intensive postoperative support.
Long-standing Persistent or Permanent Atrial Fibrillation
Patients with long-standing persistent or permanent AF, defined as continuous arrhythmia for over
12 months, present a more advanced and complex pathophysiology. At this stage, the atria are
often structurally remodeled, dilated, and fibrotic, leading to impaired mechanical function and
lower success rates for rhythm restoration procedures. Surgically, these cases are significantly more
challenging, particularly when rhythm interventions such as biatrial ablation or left atrial appendage
occlusion are warranted.
In addition, these patients commonly present with a high burden of comorbidities, including chronic
heart failure, renal dysfunction, and prior cerebrovascular events. These conditions elevate surgical
risk and complicate postoperative recovery. Long-term management involves lifelong

anticoagulation, close rhythm and rate control, and multidisciplinary coordination with heart failure
specialists, electrophysiologists, and anticoagulation management teams.
From a resource utilization perspective, the demands are markedly higher in this group. Surgical
times are longer, complication rates are higher, hospital stays are extended, and the likelihood of
readmission is increased. Their care requires detailed preoperative planning, intraoperative
precision, and rigorous postoperative monitoring, all of which contribute to significantly greater
resource consumption.
Conclusion
Due to the distinct clinical characteristics, increased surgical complexity, comorbidity burden, and
healthcare resource demands, long-standing persistent and permanent atrial fibrillation should be
formally recognized and classified as major comorbid conditions. This designation would more
accurately reflect the care realities faced by providers and support the comprehensive, high-level
treatment these patients require.
