As a student of Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a
citizen deeply invested in the health of our oceans and climate, I submit this comment in strong
opposition to the expansion of offshore oil and gas leasing as proposed in the 11th National
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program.
While Section 18 of the OCS Lands Act outlines the importance of balancing national energy
needs with environmental protection, the continued pursuit of offshore drilling undermines this
balance and jeopardizes both ecological integrity and public safety. The OCS is not only a vital
economic and ecological resource, but also a frontline in our collective effort to address climate
change and preserve marine biodiversity.
The environmental risks of offshore drilling are severe and well-documented. Oil spills—like the
Deepwater Horizon disaster—have long-term impacts on marine life, fisheries, coastal
economies, and human health. Even without spills, routine drilling operations release pollutants
into marine ecosystems and contribute to ocean acidification. Additionally, seismic exploration
harms marine mammals and disrupts delicate food webs essential to ocean health.
Expanding offshore oil and gas infrastructure also contradicts U.S. climate goals and our
obligations under international climate agreements. According to BOEM’s own 2021 National
Assessment, the OCS contains an estimated 68.79 billion barrels of undiscovered oil. If burned,
these reserves would release hundreds of millions of tons of CO₂—fueling a climate crisis
already impacting coastal communities through sea level rise, increased storm intensity, and
ocean warming.
Rather than investing in outdated and dangerous fossil fuel development, the federal government
should pivot to offshore renewable energy, such as wind and wave power, which provides
sustainable economic opportunities and aligns with long-term energy security goals. The
Inflation Reduction Act has already made strong investments in clean energy
infrastructure—continuing to open new offshore oil leases undermines this progress.
Furthermore, including regions such as the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic—where local opposition
is high and ecological sensitivity is acute—shows a disregard for regional and Tribal sovereignty.
These communities, particularly Indigenous nations, deserve genuine consultation and respect
for their right to determine what happens in their territories.
I urge the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to prioritize environmental stewardship and
climate resilience by removing proposed lease sales from the 11th National OCS Program and
instead advancing a national strategy rooted in clean energy, equity, and long-term ecological
sustainability.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments.
