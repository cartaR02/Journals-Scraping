SUBJECT: Long-Term Performance of Spray DryerFabric FilterKarbon InjectiodSelective
Non-Catalytic Reduction Air Pollution Control Systems at Five Municipal Waste

This memorandum summarizes the long-term emissions performance of spray
dryedfabric filterkarbon injectiodselective non-catalytic reduction (SD/FF/CI/SNCR) air
n control systems at five municipal waste combustion (MWC) plants. In 1995, after the
guidelines and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) were proposed for large
MWC units, EPA obtained source test data from 1994 to 1995 for the following five MWC
plants:
* Bucks County, PA
Hennepin, MN
Lee County, FL
0
Onondaga, NY
Union County, NJ
In 1995, these five MWC plants (12 units in total) were equipped with SD/FF/CT/SNCR
. The source test data demonstrate that between 1994 and 1995 all
ese five plants were meeting the proposed emission limits (both
NSPS and emission guidelines) for large MWC units. A summary of the test data for these units
is shown in Attachment 1.
In the summer of 1999, EPA obtained source test data from 1997 through 1999 for these
same five MWC plants to evaluate the long-term performance of SD/FF/CI/SNCR air pollution
control systems. A summary of the more recent test data is provided in Attachment 2. Based on
