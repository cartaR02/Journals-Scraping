Subject: Docket No. FAA-2025-0626; Project Identifier MCAI-2024-00713-T
Airworthiness Directives: Airbus Model A318, A319, A320, A321 series airplanes.
IN SUPPORT
Dear Sir or Madam:
The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), representing the safety interests of more than 79,000
professional airline pilots flying for 42 airlines in the United States and Canada, has reviewed the
subject document.
The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318,
A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a heavy
maintenance check that found elongation on the upper section of the vertical member's assembly
at the frame (FR) 24A cargo panel sub-structure. This proposed AD would require a check for
certain repairs, and as applicable, repetitive detailed visual inspections of the vertical member's
upper part and the upper fittings at FR 24A in the forward cargo compartment and corrective
actions. ALPA supports the subject proposed AD.
ALPA appreciates the opportunity to comment.
Sincerely,
Yonas Aboye
Staff Engineer
Engineering & Air Safety Department
