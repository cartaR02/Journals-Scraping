Re: Addendum to Comments on Proposed Standards of Performance for New
Stationary Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Large Municipal
Waste Combustors Voluntary Remand Response and 5- Year Review Large
Municipal Waste Incinerator Standards [EPA–HQ–OAR–2017–0183]
On behalf of East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, Ironbound Community
Corporation, Sierra Club, South Baltimore Community Land Trust, Clean Water Action, and the
Environmental Integrity Project (“EIP”) (collectively, “Commenters”), Earthjustice and EIP
submit this addendum to our prior comments on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s
(“EPA’s”) proposed revisions to its emission standards for Large Municipal Waste Combustors
(“LMWCs”) under Section 129 of the Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “the Act”), 89 Fed. Reg. 4,243
(“Proposed Rule”). These comments add to and incorporate the comments and attachments
thereto that many of the above groups submitted on March 25, 2024 in this docket, and on June
6, 2023 in EPA’s pre-rulemaking docket, as well as the March 25, 2024 report of Bruce Buckheit
(“2024 Buckheit Report”).1 These comments also incorporate the expert report and
accompanying MACT floor calculation spreadsheet of Bruce Buckheit (“2025 Buckheit
Report”), attached here,2 and the state emissions data submitted to the EPA Docket Center via
USB on May 27, 2024.3

Stack Test Data (May 27, 2025) (attached as Ex. 2).
3 Signed Acknowledgement of Receipt from Beth Gonzales, EPA Docket Center (May 27, 2025) (attached as Ex. 3).
The state emissions data and 2025 Buckheit Report are submitted in reference to EPA’s
duty to calculate the LMWC MACT floors using the most reliable and most recent data that EPA
has. As explained in Section B of the undersigned’s 2024 comments, the Clean Air Act requires
EPA to use the most recent emissions data available to EPA when calculating MACT floors, and
governing law “most certainly d[oes] not mandate that EPA must proceed from the data set it had
employed in the initial [rulemaking],” i.e. 1990s emissions data.4 And since the Clean Air Act
requires that Section 129 emission limits “shall not be less stringent” than the MACT floors,5
EPA has no room to carve out any exemptions – case-by-case or otherwise – from the emission
limits.6
As the tables below show, using all of the reliable emissions data available to EPA results
in MACT floors that are even more protective of incinerator-adjacent communities than the
floors that EPA calculated in the Proposed Rule using assumed 1990 emissions. This is true even
when using the highly flawed Upper Prediction Limit approach that EPA prefers, which tends to
weaken emission limits in a manner not allowed by the Clean Air Act (see “EG Floors (UPL) per
this review” columns below).7 Even more protective limits result from the method compelled by
the plain text of the Clean Air Act (see “EG Floor - average of highest test result for each unit in
the top 17 - per this review” columns below).

As our prior comments, the Buckheit reports, and the state emissions data make clear,
incinerators are significant emitters of criteria pollutants and hazardous air pollutants – and are
often the largest emitters in the communities where they are located. But incinerators are also
major emitters of greenhouse gases – studies show that incinerators emit significantly more
greenhouse gases than any other power source.10 EPA calculates that waste incineration results
in 12.7 million to 13.7 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent GHG emissions per year.11
While recent legal developments have stayed the enforcement and effectiveness of the
Good Neighbor Plan and its 24-hour 110 ppm NOx limit that applies to certain states during the
ozone season,12 that alone should not affect EPA’s proposal to adopt a 110 ppm limit for existing
sources in this LMWC Rule, since EPA’s cost-benefit analysis does not significantly change
even assuming the non-existence of the Good Neighbor Plan. EPA’s Proposed Rule had
excluded units covered by the Good Neighbor Plan’s 110 ppm NOx limit in its cost-benefit
analysis, but when factoring those costs and benefits back in, the industry-wide cost per ton for
meeting the 110 ppm limit is still only $5,538/ton.13 This is comparable to the $5,191 cost/ton
for NOx that EPA found reasonable in the Proposed Rule, and is still well below the overall (all

pollutant) $7,007/ton of EPA’s preferred approach in the Proposed Rule,14 as well as below the
$7,500/ton threshold that EPA employed in the Good Neighbor Plan.15 And when excluding
LMWC facilities like those in Pennsylvania that are already subject to a presumptive 110 ppm
limit (and thus would not incur any additional costs if EPA were also to set a 110 ppm limit), the
overall cost/ton goes down to $5,305/ton.16 And these calculations use the same cost
assumptions from the Proposed Rule, where EPA chose to assume the higher of two possible
costs for Covanta Low-NOx technology “as a worst-case scenario.”17 So any changes to the
Good Neighbor Plan would result in no material changes to the cost-benefit analysis here, and
are no reason for EPA to weaken its proposal for a 110 ppm NOx limit in the LMWC Rule.
Furthermore, as previously stated, many LMWCs are already subject to the 110 ppmv 24-
hour NOx limit that EPA proposed for the Emissions Guidelines or have otherwise installed the
associated control technology. In 2019, Virginia required two mass-burn LMWCs – the Fairfax
facility and the Alexandria/Arlington facility – in that state to meet this limit under the
Reasonably Available Control Technology (“RACT”) standard.18 Pennsylvania finalized a
presumptive NOx RACT limit of 110 ppmv on a 24-hour basis for LMWCs in 2022.19 A permit
was issued in December 2023 requiring the Delaware Valley Resource Recovery Facility
(“DVRRF”) located in Chester City, Pennsylvania to meet the 110 ppmv 24-hour NOx limit.20
The DVRRF is the first LMWC in the country that uses rotary combustors to be subject to the
new limit, which will be met using SNCR on its six rotary combustors.21 In June 2022, the
Ozone Transport Commission (“OTC”) approved a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) in
which eleven member jurisdictions agreed to work together to achieve greater NOx reductions
from MWCs,22 referencing an OTC workgroup white paper that found that limits of 110 ppmvd

on a 24-hour basis and 105 ppmvd on a 30-day basis are “likely achievable for most [LMWCs]
in the [Ozone Transport Region].”23 In addition, unit 3 at the LMWC located in Honolulu,
Hawaii appears to be subject to a 24-hour NOx limit of 110 ppm.24
Other LMWCs have installed either Low NOx or ASNCR. EPA’s rulemaking docket lists
20 units at 7 facilities in five states that are already equipped with Low NOx or ASNCR.25 For
example, the Montgomery County Resource Recovery facility in Maryland has been using “Low
NOx” technology since 2009.26 The LMWC located in Baltimore City, meanwhile, was
retrofitted with ASNCR between 2022 and 2023.27
EPA originally set the deadline for this public comment period to July 16, 2025,28 and the
undersigned have been requesting and collecting incinerator emissions data in accordance with
that date. But on April 21, 2025, EPA published notice that it was shortening the comment
period so that it would end on May 30, 2025 – a month and a half earlier than the original
deadline, and just over a month after notice of the deadline change.29 The undersigned submit
this data now in accordance with EPA’s change to the public comment period, but nevertheless
reserve the right to submit any additional emissions data that is received from States (and any
updates to the expert report based on that data) after May 30, 2025.
