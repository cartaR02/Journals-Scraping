To Whom It May Concern,
As a practicing cardiothoracic surgeon with over 30 years of experience, I have cared for
thousands of patients requiring surgical treatment for complex cardiac conditions. My practice
includes mitral and aortic valve replacements, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and
Cox-Maze IV procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF). Over the years, I have seen firsthand how
atrial fibrillation-particularly in its long-standing persistent or permanent forms-dramatically
alters the surgical landscape and increases both procedural risk and postoperative complexity.
Newly Diagnosed Atrial Fibrillation ,
Patients with newly diagnosed AF, including paroxysmal or early persistent types, generally
present with relatively preserved atrial structure and function. These individuals often respond
well to early rhythm control strategies, and when they undergo cardiac surgery for another
indication, adjunctive procedures such as surgical ablation or left atrial appendage exclusion can
be performed with a high likelihood of success and minimal additional risk. Their stroke risk is
more manageable, and their postoperative course tends to be more straightforward.
Long-standing Persistent or Permanent Atrial Fibrillation
In contrast, patients with long-standing persistent or permanent AF-defined as sustained
arrhythmia for over 12 months-represent a far more complex clinical challenge. By this stage,
the atria are often significantly dilated and fibrotic, impairing mechanical function and reducing
the effectiveness of rhythm control strategies. These patients often require more extensive
surgical interventions, including biatrial ~blation, which are technically demanding and
inherently higher risk.
Importantly, these patients frequently have a greater burden of comorbidities such as heart
failure, renal dysfunction, and prior strokes, all of which increase operative and postoperative
risk. They often require lifelong anticoagulation and coordinated care involving multiple
specialties. Managing these patients successfully requires not only surgical expertise but also a
multidisciplinary approach before, during, and after surgery.
Having performed Cox-Maze IV procedures as part of my routine surgical care, I know that the
risks are significantly higher in patients with long-standing persistent AF. The complexity of the

procedure, coupled with the fragile state of the atria and accompanying comorbidities, means
these patients consume more operative time, require longer hospital stays, and are at higher risk
of postoperative complications and readmissions.
Conclusion
These are not just advanced cases of AF-they are a distinct category of disease requiring a
higher intensity of care, deeper planning, and greater resources. I strongly urge the appropriate
regulatory bodies to recognize long-standing persistent and permanent atrial fibrillation as major
comorbid conditions. This classification would better reflect the clinical reality and support the
comprehensive care these patients require.
