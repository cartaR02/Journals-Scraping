Federal Docket for this proposal and are under 50MG in size (entitled “WTEA.Files Already
Uploaded to Federal Docket (Under 50MB Size)”; and (2) the second folder contains 45 files
that are over 50MG in size and have not yet been uploaded to the Federal Docket (entitled”
“WTEA.Files NOT Uploaded to Federal Docket (Over 50MG Size)”, and we are providing them
