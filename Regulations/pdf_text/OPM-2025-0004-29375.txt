Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” Proposed Rule, 90
Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 Dear Office of Personnel Management:
Yvonne Haefner submits these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Proposed
Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed. Reg.
17182 (April 23, 2025).
I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.
1. I am a retired Federal Employee in a conservation field, who saw how political heads changed with
the party in control. I saw when those political heads lacked the knowledge that career employees have
a lot of times in the field where I worked.
2. Often the appointed political head made decisions that were detrimental with applying conservation
on the ground. Was this efficient? No! It often hindered the work being done. I saw private companies
applying conservation in a haphazard method without sound engineering or planning experience. “If civil
servants were hired not based primarily on expertise, but on who they knew, conservation practices
would fail
3. Employees who are hired at will and fired at will are not loyal. Performance suffers because there is
the constant fear of being fired. Right now fellow co-workers in the field fear for their jobs. Tomorrow
they come to work and there is no one else there.
For the reasons stated above, I oppose the proposed rule.
Sincerely,
Yvonne Haefner
Retired Federal Employee
