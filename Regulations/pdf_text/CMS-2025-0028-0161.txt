RE: Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute
Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and
Policy Changes and Fiscal Year 2026 Rates; Requirements for Quality Programs; and
Other Policy Changes [CMS–1833–P]
Dear Administrator Oz,
I am pleased to submit comments on the proposed update to payment rates and policies for the
Medicare Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) for fiscal year 2026 (“the
Proposed Rule.”)[1] I have treated patients with valvular heart disease since the inception of
transcatheter aortic valve replacement and lead a large academic valve center.
CMS should reconsider its rejection of the request to reassign cases reporting transcatheter
aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures for aortic regurgitation (AR) from MS-DRGs 266
and 267 to a more clinically and cost cohesive MS-DRG.
In the Proposed Rule, CMS considered a proposal to move cases with TAVR for Aortic
Regurgitation (AR) from MS-DRGs 266/267 to MS-DRG 215.[2] As analyzed by CMS, the cases
identified do not warrant a move, however it appears the CMS analysis includes diagnosis code
I35.2 (Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis with insufficiency), which inadvertently identified
beneficiaries with mixed valvular heart disease and predominant AS. Including diagnosis code
I35.2 as part of this consideration doesn’t allow an understanding of the costs of patients with
predominant AR.
The inclusion of I35.2 increased the dataset volume (e.g., the requestor identified 280 cases in
their analysis, but CMS identified 8,137 discharges). In 2023, only ~180 TAVR for AR cases
were done during the continued access protocol for the ALIGN-AR, which was the only
approved (Category B IDE) use of TAVR for AR. There have never been >8,000 TAVR for AR
cases performed.
I encourage CMS to refine their analysis to exclude cases with aortic stenosis by analyzing the
discharges without ICD-10 CM code I35.2 and, if the data supports, assign these cases to a
more clinically and cost cohesive MS-DRG.
Sincerely,
