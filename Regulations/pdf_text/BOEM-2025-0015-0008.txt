RE: BOEM’s request for information regarding Offshore Drilling and the National Outer
Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program
Dear Ms. Hammerle or to Whom it May Concern,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to any new offshore oil and gas leasing off the
th
coast of the United States in the 11 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing
Program, particularly off the east coast of Florida, where I have had my business since 2014.
Coastal economies like Florida’s are built on the foundation of clean beaches, healthy
ecosystems, and vibrant tourism and marine industries like mine.
Offshore drilling puts all of that at risk. Even the perception of risk from oil and gas activity can
negatively affect tourism, property values, and investor confidence. A major spill would have
long-lasting consequences for small businesses, fisheries, and the thousands of jobs that rely on a
healthy coastal environment.
I believe it is NOT in the best interest of our community, or our economy, to open our coasts to
offshore drilling. The long-term threats to coastal livelihoods, local industries, and our natural
resources far outweigh the potential short-term benefits to energy companies.
I urge the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to take these economic concerns seriously and
to prioritize the protection of our coasts in the upcoming leasing program. I also call on our
elected officials in Congress to support policies that safeguard our shorelines and reject any
efforts to expand offshore oil and gas development.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments. I appreciate your consideration of the
interests of coastal businesses and communities like mine.
Sincerely,
Susan Steinhauser
