performing each detailed visual inspection. 1. All clevises were magnetic particle
inspected when this issue was first identified
(Ref. TCCA AD CF 2021-26 and FAA AD
2021-24-09). Any suspect clevises will have
been removed from the fleet at that time.
2. The detailed visual inspection is conducted
using 10x magnification (IAW Bell ASB 430-
22-61) which is sufficient to detect corrosion
damage which may act as crack initiation
sites.
3. Operators are instructed to do an MPI if
any suspected defects are found during the
10x visual inspection.
It is therefore recommended to remove the
additional MPI requirements at line (h)(4).
